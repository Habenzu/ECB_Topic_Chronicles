It follows that EMEs push for an inclusion of global liquidity and its drivers into multilateral surveillance, whereas advanced countries see a need for more scrutiny of reserve accumulation practices, exchange rate policies and capital controls. Against this background, it is also obvious that a lot of countries do not have any appetite to change the IMF’s Articles of Agreement to ratify a broadening and strengthening of surveillance. What can be done in such circumstances? I think that first of all we need to work even harder to achieve a better understanding of interlinkages and spillover effects. This implies the need for more and better analysis. The new pilot spillover reports that the IMF started this year with a handful of systemically important countries are one welcome step in that direction. Further research on the impact of policies in systemically important economies on global liquidity conditions and on capital flows will also help framing the discussions. Going forward, better awareness, a certain spirit of multilateralism and, last but not least, improved mechanisms to foster traction of policy advice will be crucial elements to strengthen the effectiveness of surveillance in contributing to global stability. Evolution of global official liquidity Another area in which views are very much divided is the debate about the enhancement of official liquidity provision. One idea is to strength the so-called global financial safety net (GFSN). It would be used in those exceptional situations when countries with sound fundamentals suffer from financial market disruptions – such as foreign currency liquidity shortages or sudden stops in capital inflows – caused by contagion from major (e.g. Lehman-type) external shocks Also here significant progress has been achieved over the last years: IMF resources have', ' shown that fiscal consolidation led to cumulative deviations from the baseline evolution in 2011-2013 between 8% in Germany to 18% in Greece. [ 14 ] Another academic paper using different models finds a loss deviation from baseline between 14% to 20% for the euro area GDP during the same period. [ 15 ] The absence of a co-ordinated fiscal policy from a euro area wide perspective has been a core problem of monetary union. Third, economic and financial integration was not accompanied by any sort of European level supervision of the financial system, particularly of banks. The huge capital inflows into the European periphery, without due consideration to concentration and proper credit risk management, were not countered by prudential supervision that was fragmented across countries. Under pressure of events, some answers to these three types of problems were found with the creation of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) and the Banking Union, a project still incomplete. These responses illustrate that a monetary union can never be just a matter of demanding and assuming that individual member countries behave appropriately. The diversity of shocks, the level of financial integration and interdependence requires collective mechanisms for discipline and risk sharing. The unavoidable, political economy debate stems from this. Stronger countries are tempted to deny that overall stability demands some risk sharing and instead, underline mechanisms of risk reduction. Vulnerable countries tend to resist acceptance of severe risk reduction measures if risk sharing is not sufficiently present. No surprise then that the discussion on continuing the repair of monetary union shortcomings has clustered around two approaches: one more minimalist and concentrated on risk reduction in weaker countries and the other more comprehensive, aimed at including also elements of risk sharing with a certain dose of fiscal union. In this last category, one could include the Five Presidents’ Report, several documents by the European Commission and the IMF. [ 16 ]', '6 per cent in 2026. We are determined to ensure that inflation returns to our two per cent medium-term target in a timely manner. We will keep policy rates sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary to achieve this aim. We will continue to follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction. In particular, our interest rate decisions will be based on our assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. We are not pre-committing to a particular rate path. The Governing Council today also confirmed that it will reduce the Eurosystem’s holdings of securities under the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) by €7.5 billion per month on average over the second half of the year. The modalities for reducing the PEPP holdings will be broadly in line with those followed under the asset purchase programme (APP). The decisions taken today are set out in a press release available on our website. I will now outline in more detail how we see the economy and inflation developing and will then explain our assessment of financial and monetary conditions. Economic activity After five quarters of stagnation, the euro area economy grew by 0.3 per cent over the first quarter of 2024. The services sector is expanding, and manufacturing is showing signs of stabilisation at low levels. We expect the economy to continue to recover as higher wages and improved terms of trade push up real incomes. Stronger exports should also support growth over the coming quarters, as global demand for goods and services rises. Finally, monetary policy should exert less of a drag on demand over time. Employment rose by 0.3 per cent in the first quarter of this year, with around 500']"

Nevertheless, meeting the challenges of technological progress and preserving the labour force’s employability and flexibility require that human capital continuously adjusts to labour market needs through improved education and training as well as lifelong learning. We need to think of market-oriented measures which enhance the incentives of firms, employees and unemployed people to invest in education and knowledge. Structural measures aiming at increasing labour supply, however, would not solve the serious unemployment problem in the euro area, which requires the fostering of labour demand through higher wage flexibility and adjustments to the level of employment protection legislation, in particular where this legislation impedes the hiring of younger and older workers. Second, increasing competition in an effort to establish efficient and well-functioning product and service markets is another prerequisite for higher medium to long-term growth. A lack of competition harms productivity trends by limiting production efficiency and by reducing the incentive to innovate. Restrictions on competition also hinder job creation. In the EU, it is crucial to build on the experience of several network industries that are now fully or largely open to competition. For example, the extensive liberalisation of the telecommunication sector in the course of the 1990s led hourly labour productivity in that sector to grow on average by 8.5% in the euro area over the period 1996-2003 compared with 6.9% in the US. [ 3 ] If liberalisation and higher competition are pursued in other services sectors, it is very likely that such excellent productivity growth performances can be repeated. And to the extent that nominal wage moderation is ensured conditions for job creation are enhanced. In this respect, it is crucial that policies aimed at increasing the level of competition and at liberalising the product markets include the extension and deepening of', ' growth in Europe reflect European preferences for more leisure. However, we should bear in mind that lower participation rates are not necessarily solely associated with personal preferences, but are also triggered by legal and regulatory environment, tax systems and social institutions. Benefit systems that are too generous discourage job search, early retirement schemes encourage early withdrawal from the labour market – employment rates for older workers aged 55-64 stood at just 40.2% in the euro area in 2005 [ 11 ] and at around 60% in the US [ 12 ] – and marginal tax rates that are too high discourage labour market entry and have a downward effect on average hours worked. To increase labour utilisation and get people into work, necessary labour supply side measures include the reform of tax and benefit systems to address these problems and increase incentives to work. Measures aimed at reconciling motherhood with professional life, such as the provision of child care would contribute to raising participation rates. Furthermore, the use of flexible forms of work such as part-time and temporary work would also provide further working incentives. [ 13 ] High unemployment rates in the euro area and in particular high youth unemployment rates, amounting to 17.8% in 2005, stresses the need to spur not only labour supply but also labour demand. [ 14 ] In this context, there is a need to promote wage flexibility and to address labour market rigidities. Furthermore, adjustments to the level of employment protection legislation are needed where they impede the hiring of younger and older workers in particular. Increasing competition towards establishing efficient and well-functioning product markets is another prerequisite for higher medium to long-term growth. [ 15 ] A lack of competition harms productivity trends by limiting production efficiency and by reducing the incentive to innovate. In the EU, some progress has been made in this regard. For example, several network industries,', ' Without aiming to be exhaustive, I should like to highlight some of the key priorities for reform in four main areas, namely getting people into work, increasing competition, unlocking business potential and supporting an innovative environment. First of all , well-functioning labour markets are extremely important in fostering high economic growth. The divergent pattern displayed by growth and labour utilisation in the US and in Europe has prompted some economists to suggest the existence of a ‘European model’ and a ‘US model’, related to the trade-off between labour use and productivity. [ 7 ] One view is that the lower levels of GDP per capita in Europe reflect European preferences for more leisure. However, we should bear in mind that lower participation rates are not necessarily solely associated with personal preferences, but are also triggered by the legal and regulatory environment, tax systems and social institutions. Benefit systems that are too generous discourage job search, early retirement schemes encourage early withdrawal from the labour market - employment rates for older workers aged 55-64 stood at just 40.2% in the euro area in 2005 and, according to the OECD, at around 60% in the US - and marginal tax rates that are too high discourage labour market entry and have a downward effect on average hours worked.

The Governing Council welcomes the ongoing work and urges further specific and decisive steps to complete the banking union and the capital markets union. We are now at your disposal for questions. * * * Mr President, could you give us an idea about the reasons why you decided on the specific features of the TLTRO-III programme? For example why are the maturities two years? Why have you indexed it to the MRO, and also why is the start date in September when the funding becomes relevant for banks' Net Stable Funding Ratios in June already. My second question is what you would like to achieve with this programme, so are you trying to keep the size of the balance sheet stable? Or are you trying to add extra accommodation? Draghi: The design of the TLTRO responds to a variety of objectives. The key objective derives from how the situation of bank funding looks like over the next few years. In the coming years we will have a congestion for bank funding caused by the coming to maturity of the existing TLTROs, the coming to maturity of sizable amounts of bank bonds, various regulatory compliances. The TLTROs, as has been said in the introductory statement, maintain [and] preserve favourable bank lending conditions and a smooth transition of monetary policy. Now, the precise design, whether it's two instead of four, do reflect the changed conditions we have today. Now, further details especially on the pricing and other details, will get to be known in due time. Now, the second question really addresses the substance of today's meeting so\", \" to achieve a more growth-friendly composition of public finances.

The Governing Council welcomes the ongoing work and urges further specific and decisive steps to complete the banking union and the capital markets union. We are now at your disposal for questions. * * * The IMF just at their last meeting raised concerns about the effects of low interest rates on the financial system, so my first question would be: what makes you so confident that more of negative rates and quantitative easing or asset purchases is doing more good than harm? My second question would be on your legacy and whether you feel it's been tarnished by the recent discussions, which were unusually public, about the rift in the Governing Council and the disagreement about the policy action taken? President Draghi: Well, the IMF didn't say that the negative rates are ineffective. As a matter of fact, the overall assessment of negative rates is generally positive. For us, it's very positive; it's been a very positive experience. Negative rates have stimulated the economy and affected positively employment, and so all in all we're exactly in the direction we wanted them to be. But the IMF also raised concerns about potential side effects of very negative rates for a long time. The discussion really didn't go into too much detail, but we are also aware of that and we are monitoring these risks. I should say that first of all we should distinguish different categories: banks, insurance companies, pension funds and other intermediaries. The overall assessment has been clearly positive. In other words, the improvements in the economy have more than offset negative side effects\", \" stance is providing support to economic activity. At the same time, countries where government debt is high need to continue rebuilding fiscal buffers. All countries should reinforce their efforts to achieve a more growth-friendly composition of public finances.

We are now at your disposal for questions. * * * You said that interest rates will remain at their current levels through the first half of next year, but the market is actually pricing for the next interest rate move to be a cut. If you look at the market reaction after you issued the policy statement, it does look like investors were actually expecting more. Would you say that markets are perhaps getting ahead of themselves even though you have said in the past that markets are pricing in the ECB's reaction function. My second question is on market-based inflation expectations, which have continued to slide recently. You've said in the past that that was because of negative risk premium predominantly, but how long can you continue to see market-based inflation expectations so low below your aim? Draghi: You have to distinguish between market-based expectations of interest rates and survey expectations. The extension of the six months of this forward guidance basically takes into account the prolongation of uncertainty with respect to what we saw and believed and deemed in March. We've seen the threat of rising protectionism and, in fact, the point made by someone about what markets see in this protectionism threat and they seem to see much more than simply the damage to\"]"

Even worse, fossil fuels received $450 billion of explicit subsidies in 2020. [ 2 ] Sharp increases in energy prices can affect the most vulnerable in society, so careful thought is needed to ensure a just transition where the benefits are shared equitably. Those paths also require substantial technological innovation and investment in climate mitigation. Public investment can catalyse private investment, and the financial sector has an important role to play. Financial institutions should outline in transition plans how they plan to adapt to a carbon-free world. The Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero [ 3 ] is taking the first steps in that direction. Complete, internationally consistent and auditable disclosure data can help to ensure funds flow to where they are needed most, while avoiding the risk of greenwashing. The ECB’s contributions to combating climate change Central banks also have a role to play. The impact of natural catastrophes and the green transition on inflation directly affects the ECB’s primary mandate of price stability, which is why we are paying increasing attention to climate change. [ 4 ] It also creates risks for the banks we supervise and for the ECB’s own balance sheet. We are not alone in our concern. Around 100 central banks and financial supervisors worldwide have come together as part of the Network for Greening the Financial System. [ 5 ] The Network seeks to contribute to the development of climate and environmental risk management within the financial sector and mobilise finance to support the green transition. Yesterday the ECB publicly pledged to contribute, within our field of responsibility, to decisive action by policymakers to implement the Paris Agreement and mitigate the consequences of climate change. [ 6 ] Climate change was an important consideration in our recent', ' to pre-industrial levels). In the other two scenarios, current macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions lead to a delay in green transition efforts until the end of 2025. In the “late-push transition” scenario, the green transition starts in 2026 and is intense enough to achieve emission reductions by 2030. The expected results are comparable to those in the accelerated transition, but they come at a higher cost, as the policies needed to achieve them are more ambitious and abrupt. In the “delayed transition” scenario, the transition also starts in 2026 but is more gradual and slower than in the late-push transition. It is therefore not ambitious enough to achieve emission targets in line with the Paris Agreement goals by 2030. The green transition and potential ways forward Under the three scenarios, how would greenhouse gas emissions, global temperatures and investment efforts develop? Chart 1, panel a) shows the historical and projected emission pathways compared with a baseline scenario that assumes that nothing will be done beyond currently implemented policies. In the long term the temperature increase in the delayed transition scenario is substantially higher than in the other two scenarios at 2.6°C compared with 1.5°C relative to pre-industrial levels. A delayed transition is therefore expected to lead to much higher physical risk in the long term via more frequent and more intense wildfires and floods than we are already currently experiencing. [ 4 ] The transition towards net zero requires substantial investment in energy-efficient and renewable energy, such as solar and wind energy, as well as in phasing out fossil fuels. Chart 1, panel b) presents the total required investment based on bottom-up estimates for the three scenarios. An accelerated or late-push transition would require companies and households to invest significant funds from the very start of the transition, with green investment adding up to around', '-related stress tests of the banking system. These assessments evaluate banks’ resilience to various climate scenarios and cover approximately 2.9 million companies and over 2,900 banks. Our second stress test, conducted in 2023, revealed that banks are exposed to the highest credit risk if the green transition is rushed at a later stage and investment is required quickly at higher costs. In the “late push” transition scenario, banks can expect to see their credit risk more than double by 2030 compared with 2022. [ 17 ] Advising The results of this analysis influence our own internal thinking and guide our approach to policymaking, allowing us to offer better-informed and more targeted advice. For example, in European and international fora we support the implementation of key preconditions for the green transition, such as an effective carbon price that reflects the true social cost of carbon emissions, better and more comprehensive climate disclosures and the completion of the EU capital markets union. We formulate recommendations in the form of legal opinions on climate-related legislation, such as the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive. And we aim to disseminate our analysis to enrich the wider policy debate and raise awareness of the potential impacts of climate change, including through our involvement in the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS). In this context, the ECB has contributed to key areas of the NGFS work programme, such as the Workstream on Scenario Design and Analysis. This workstream offers an invaluable climate risk assessment tool that provides policymakers globally with essential guidance. [ 18 ] Furthermore, we chair the NGFS Experts’ Network on Legal Issues. The work on climate litigation has been instrumental in increasing awareness of this growing source of risk. [ 19 ] Acting And that leads me to my final point.

Therefore, actual inflation figures, as they come out from month to month, are only being used as one of the indicators to determine our assessment of the policy to be pursued. Now the forecasts, as we have published them, are one of the elements on which we base our assessment of this forward-looking development of inflation and other economic variables. They are one of the elements, not the exclusive one, and also, for our decisions, which we have to take every two weeks, those forecasts, as you know them, and as they have been published, become very quickly totally outdated. So we continuously reassess the value or the validity of the forecasts as they have been produced three or four or five months ago. Chairman, Mrs Randzio-Plath (PES/D) Thank you very much. Mr Huhne. Mr Huhne (ELDR/UK) Madam President. Perhaps Mr Duisenberg would come back to the question of the US. I'd just ask you whether, given the very strong reaction to developments in the US from the US Federal Reserve and indeed the fact that some other central banks have been reacting in the direction of an insurance principle - by getting some small reduction in interest rates in, in foreseeing potential impact on their economies of developments in the US and other economies around the world - whether you think that there is room for a similar insurance principle in the euro area. Particularly since, as you have said in your introduction, the balance of risks has clearly moved and you point out the fall, both in the observed inflation rate and, indeed, in the first pillar, the slowdown in monetary growth. Mr Duisenberg Yes, and then I concluded that the balance\", 'cture, fiscal policies should avoid any pro-cyclical bias and should aim at reaching sustainable fiscal positions in the medium term more quickly. We are now at your disposal, should you have any questions. Transcript of the questions asked and the answers given by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the ECB and Christian Noyer, Vice-President of the ECB Question: President Duisenberg, Professor Issing has announced that the ECB is likely to publish inflation forecasts in the near future. What value does the publication of these forecasts have, given the fact that you apparently have to revise them every four to six weeks? And secondly, was there a formal vote today? Duisenberg: I will not comment on votes. And the effects that forecasts will have, which will have to be revised almost continuously, whereas we will not publish them continuously, is a normal fact of life. Circumstances change considerably and continuously and forecasts - whether they are published or not - will have to be re-assessed and re-formulated continuously as events develop. Question (translation): Mr. Duisenberg, in the recent past it seemed if the European Central Bank was specifically insisting on surprise effects. It was surprising to have interventions on 22 September 2000 and it was equally surprising to see that you have today increased your interest rates? What about predictability and accountability? Do they no longer count, are they no longer important? Duisenberg: Sometimes surprises cannot be avoided. As my colleague, Alan Greenspan, has said, \"sometimes surprises can be an element of policy\" and they have to be. But it is not our aim to surprise. With interventions; yes. The surprise elements are a basic factor in the success of eventual intervention. With interest rates: no. It is not our aim', \" So there you have one other reason. Question (translation): Mr. Duisenberg, I have two questions. First, the ECB Council certainly approved the projections that are supposed to be published in eight days. What are these projections worth if you are saying that the interest rates are not going to change and that there is a higher expectation that in two or three months or maybe one month interest rates will not remain unchanged? Second question, risk projections. How big is the risk that American share markets and the American stock exchange will collapse and that this might have an effect on the dollar rate? How do you see this and its impact on the world economy? Duisenberg: I cannot answer the last question. If there is a sudden collapse in any financial market that would be speculating to an irresponsible extent. And you can imagine yourself, what the consequences would be. Now, we will publish – as we do twice a year – our new forecast in, I believe, seven days time, in the forthcoming issue of the Monthly Bulletin, and this still has to be finalised. Also, after today's discussion there were suggestions – although they are staff forecasts – and suggestions can be made and have been made. They will contain ranges and I can assure you that they will reflect the slightly worsened outlook for inflation as compared with the previous prognosis. That is not to say that they have already reached a level which would cause us to act today. Question: Mr. Duisenberg, Mr. Mer, the French Finance Minister, told us today that the Stability and Growth Pact is nothing to worry about because it is not written in stone. Could you please comment on this? Should we not be worried that more and more State will try and neglect the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact? Duisenberg: I heard\"]"

         "[' We at the ECB see it as an objective that is achieved when potential market participants with the same relevant characteristics face a single set of rules, have equal access to markets and are treated equally. If the opportunities thus created have been exploited by market forces to a substantial degree, financial integration will have been attained. Success in advancing towards that goal has varied across market segments. While the euro has undoubtedly played a very important role as a catalyst for financial integration in general, it is a fact that integration is more advanced in the market segments that are closer to the single monetary policy, notably the money market. There we have achieved almost complete integration, thanks, inter alia, to the establishment of the necessary pan-European payment infrastructure (the TARGET system). A fully integrated interbank money market was, and is, a sine qua non for the implementation of the single monetary policy, since it ensures an even distribution of central bank liquidity and a homogeneous level of short-term interest rates across the euro area. Integration in bond markets has also progressed significantly. Government bond yields have converged considerably and they are now mainly driven by euro area-wide shocks and news, and only a small fraction of yields can be explained by national risk factors. The convergence of government bond yields has largely been due to the elimination of (intra-euro area) exchange rate risks and the convergence of inflation expectations across countries as a result of the introduction of the euro. The corporate bond market has witnessed exceptional growth since 1999 and is also fairly integrated, in the sense that the country of issuance is only of marginal importance in explaining yield differentials. From a central banking perspective, the development of an integrated corporate bond market is of relevance, as a shift from intermediated financing to market financing implies a diminished role for the bank-lending channel', ' indicators regarding the state of integration of euro area financial and banking markets. Let me summarise our findings. While the euro has undoubtedly acted as a catalyst for financial integration in general, it is true that the degree of integration differs from market segment to market segment, with integration being more advanced in those market segments that are closer to the single monetary policy, notably the money market. There we have achieved almost complete integration, thanks, inter alia, to the establishment of the necessary pan-European payment infrastructure, the TARGET system. Integration in bond markets has also progressed significantly. Government bond yields have converged to a large degree and they are now mainly driven by euro area-wide shocks and news. The euro area corporate bond market has grown considerably in recent years, to five times its size, and is also fairly integrated, in the sense that the country of issuance is only of marginal importance in explaining yield differentials. The integration of equity markets in Europe is a slow and more laborious process of overcoming fragmentation. That said, there are encouraging signs of an increasing degree of integration, such as the substantial decrease in the so-called “home bias” in the equity holdings of investment and pension funds, and a more homogeneous reaction of equity prices across the euro area to monetary policy signals. The pace of integration in the banking sector has been uneven. Integration is well advanced in wholesale and capital-related activities, while it is lagging behind in the retail markets. This partly reflects differences in the nature of competition in these segments of financial services. Proximity to clients, bank-customer relationships and access to information play a key role in retail banking, while they are less crucial for investment banking and for corporate banking aimed at large companies. Overall, the rather modest progress in the integration of the banking sector', ' between countries may also still be explained by differences in liquidity and perceived credit risk. Our indicators for the state of integration of the euro corporate bond market are based on econometric models and suggest that this market segment is fairly integrated in the sense that the country of issuance is only of marginal importance in explaining yield differentials. Finally, with respect to the euro area equity market, our indicators show that the elimination of intra-euro area currency risk has encouraged integration in that the “home bias” in the equity holdings of institutional investors has been significantly reduced as the importance of sector versus country-based investment strategies has increased. As a second measure of the euro’s success in fostering financial integration, I would like to mention the work of “the institutions behind the euro”, namely the ECB and the whole Eurosystem, which provide numerous contributions to European financial integration. Overall, we are of the view that financial integration is first and foremost a market-driven process. In addition to this, we see it as a basic task of public authorities to create a framework that is conducive to fostering financial integration. In this respect, the ECB has defined four kinds of activity with which the ECB and the Eurosystem contribute to this process: (1) we try to enhance knowledge and raise awareness of the state of and need for European financial integration, and we measure the progress made – the most obvious example in this respect is the launch of our regular monitoring on the basis of quantitative indicators of financial integration in the euro area, which I mentioned earlier; (2) we act as a catalyst for private sector activities by facilitating collective action and assisting with possible coordination problems; (3) we provide central banking services that also foster European financial integration; and (4) we provide advice on the legislative and regulatory framework for the European']"

There are good reasons to expect an increase in international public use of the euro as a reserve, intervention and pegging currency, inasmuch as the public authorities understand that it is worthwhile to allocate their foreign reserves among the main international currencies and to give the euro a relevant share in accordance with its internal and external stability and the economic and financial importance of the euro area. In connection with the use of the euro as a pegging currency, approximately 30 countries outside the euro area currently have exchange rate regimes involving the euro to a greater or lesser extent. These exchange rate regimes are currency boards (Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Estonia); currencies pegged to the euro (Cyprus, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and 14 African countries in which the CFA franc is the legal tender); currencies pegged to a basket of currencies including the euro, in some cases with a fluctuation band (Hungary, Iceland, Poland, Turkey, etc.); systems of managed floating in which the euro is used informally as the reference currency (Czech Republic, Slovak Republic and Slovenia); and, last but not least, European Union currencies pegged to the euro through a co-operative arrangement, namely ERM II. Denmark and Greece joined ERM II on 1 January 1999 with a ±2.25% fluctuation band for the Danish krone and a ±15% fluctuation band for the Greek drachma. Although the euro remains in second position after the US dollar in terms of its official use, the role of the euro will increase in the future, without a doubt, especially after the year 2002 when the euro banknotes and coins will begin to circulate. Taking the current situation as a starting point, the Eurosystem's position concerning the\", ' the euro a relevant share in accordance with its internal and external stability and the economic and financial importance of the euro area. In connection with the use of the euro as a pegging currency, approximately 30 countries outside the euro area currently have exchange rate regimes involving the euro to a greater or lesser extent. These exchange rate regimes are: currency boards (Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Estonia); currencies pegged to the euro (Cyprus, FYROM [the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia] and 14 African countries in which the CFA franc is the legal tender); currencies pegged to a basket of currencies including the euro, in some cases with a fluctuation band (Hungary, Iceland, Poland, Turkey, etc.); systems of managed floating in which the euro is used informally as the reference currency (Czech Republic, Slovak Republic and Slovenia); and, last but not least, European Union currencies pegged to the euro through a co-operative arrangement, namely ERM II. As you well know, Denmark and Greece joined ERM II on 1 January 1999 with a ±2.25% fluctuation band for the Danish krone and a ±15% fluctuation band for the Greek drachma. Although the euro remains in second position after the US dollar in terms of its official use, the role of the euro will increase in the future, without a doubt. The position of the Eurosystem concerning the international role of the euro As a general conclusion stemming from the previous analysis of the use of the euro in the world economy, we can affirm that the euro is the second most widely used currency, behind the US dollar and ahead of the Japanese yen. The private use of the euro as an investment and financing currency and its official use as a reserve, intervention and pegging currency are', \" close links to the euro (e.g. formal entitlement to use the euro as legal tender, as foreseen by the Maastricht Treaty in certain special cases, purely unilateral euroisation and currency boards, to looser forms of anchoring (e.g. crawling fluctuation bands and managed floating). Countries which anchor only to the euro are all located in the so-called euro-time zone (i.e., the geographical area that includes Europe, the Mediterranean area, the Middle East and Africa). This confirms the fact that close trade and financial links with the euro area remain the main factor behind the choice of the euro as a reference for exchange rate policy. As an intervention currency, the use of the euro is mainly related to its function as an anchor currency. However, countries with currencies not pegged to the euro may also use it for intervention purposes, in particular in the G7 context. With regard to other functions, the euro's international use has remained limited. The US dollar remains the main vehicle currency in the foreign exchange market (i.e. a currency that can be used as a means by which to exchange two other currencies) and the dominant pricing and quotation currency. The euro accounts for a fifth of the global foreign exchange market turnover. The predominance of the dollar is attributable mainly to the combined and reinforcing effects of network externalities and economies of scale in the use of the leading international currency. At the regional level, however, the euro inherited a role from its legacy currencies (mainly the Deutsche Mark), especially in Eastern Europe. As a reserve currency, the euro's share of total world foreign reserves is comparable to that reached by the euro legacy currencies (i.e. the Deutsche Mark, French franc, and Dutch guilder) prior to the introduction of the euro.

         "[' I will not comment more on that as it seems to me that we are clear enough. I have underlined the phrase “progressive withdrawal of monetary accommodation”, and what has happened in the past seems to provide all the appropriate keys to understanding how we act. As I have said several times, we are in a posture of strong vigilance today. I also remind you that, as far as the medium term is concerned, we will do what is necessary. We do not pre-commit ex ante, neither to doing nor to not doing something. We are constantly alert. We do what is necessary. It is probably because observers, economists, and market participants understand this so well that we have succeeded until now in anchoring inflationary expectations in line with our definition of price stability. Question: Could you explain the reasons behind the upgrade in growth particularly for next year? You said it was the first year that included Slovenia, so could you explain how much of that upgrade is due to the faster growth in Slovenia and how much to the current euro area economies? And a second question: given the stronger outlook for both economic growth and inflation that is shown in the staff projections, can you see a point at which the ECB will stop progressively withdrawing accommodation and start tightening credit conditions? Trichet: On the first point, Slovenia had no significant influence in these projections, taking into account Slovenia’s very small contribution to the overall consolidated GDP. As regards the sentiment surrounding the future medium-term decisions, again, we do not pre-commit ourselves in any respect. Our concept is very simple: we do what - in our opinion - is necessary to counter the inflationary risks that we see, to deliver price stability over the medium term and to be credible in the delivery of price stability. And, everything that', 'protected against inflation are the poorest and the most vulnerable in our societies, and this is very important to understand. And by the way, when we preserve price stability, we not only defend the purchasing power of the employees and of all our fellow citizens, but we are also solidly anchoring inflation expectations and preserving a financial environment which is favourable for sustainable growth and job creation. It is also very important to understand that when we call for wage responsibility from the social partners, we are simultaneously paving the way for defending, protecting and preserving the purchasing power of all our fellow citizens and the employees and workers, and we are also paving the way for sustained growth and job creation. Question: I have a couple of questions: First, you note in the introductory statement that robust growth appears to be continuing in the first half of 2007. I wonder if that does play out, whether you would continue to characterise interest rates as being on the accommodative side. Second, I know you do not like to make specific comments about exchange rates, but would you say that the euro’s current level is developing in line with the euro area’s economic fundamentals. And then, finally, if you could elaborate a little bit – has the Governing Council entertained the idea that interest-bearing components of M3 could be rising specifically because interest rates are rising and are thus perhaps not a sign of inflation pressures to come? I think you mentioned that, but I just want to make sure I’ve understood it correctly. Trichet: On your first question, I would fully confirm that we consider our current interest rates to be on the accommodative side. I said that in my introductory remarks. On the exchange rates, you know that I permanently call upon myself to exercise verbal discipline in this very important domain which we discuss with', ' there were perhaps two or three members who might have preferred, at least at the start of the discussion, another decision. What did they want? Did these members not want to move at all with a rate hike today or did they prefer to have a larger hike? Trichet: Let me be more precise. By “overwhelming majority” I meant a fully-fledged consensus. There were no other views on today’s decision. Question: The second question I have relates to the economic outlook in the short and medium term and then the medium to longer term. There are a lot of economists seeing that there might be some kind of cooling down in the euro area economy. Do you have a discussion in the Governing Council – assuming that you want to normalise interest rates, whatever you regard as a normal level – do you have a discussion in the Council that the time is running out for interest rate hikes? Trichet: First of all, the “normal level” for us is the level which permits us to deliver price stability over time, be credible in the delivery of price stability over time and solidly anchor inflationary expectations. There is our compass and the needle of the compass. Second, as I have said very often, we are pragmatic. Everybody knows what our definition of price stability is. Everybody knows what our determination is. Everybody knows what our two-pillar monetary policy strategy is. Now, we will do what is necessary, depending on facts and figures and new events. At this stage, I will not comment further. Of course, we will have new projections, as you might expect. We have our present projections.

We started to provide refinancing well above the levels that banks had absorbed to fulfil their reserve requirements in normal times. Our approach comprises three main ‘building blocks’. We significantly adapted our regular refinancing operations. We now follow a ‘fixed rate full allotment’ tender procedure and have significantly expanded the maturity of our operations. Banks have been granted access to essentially unlimited liquidity at our policy interest rate at maturities of, initially, up to six months. This is an exceptional mode of operation. In normal times we auction a given amount of central bank credit and let competition between the bidders determine the interest rate. This unusual mode of operation implies that we currently act as a surrogate for the market in terms of both liquidity allocation and price-setting. Our second building block is the long list of assets that we take as collateral. This list was already very long before the crisis, but we have extended it even further and now accept an even wider range of securities as collateral. The first two building blocks offer unlimited refinancing against a very wide range of collateral. But they can only reach the financial system if they are coupled with the third building block, namely the very large number of counterparties that have always been able to take part in our refinancing operations. Even before the financial crisis, this number was higher than for the other major central banks. Following the changes to our operational framework in October last year, this number rose further. All these non-standard measures were supplemented by further exceptional steps that the ECB’s Governing Council decided in early May and June this year. We now conduct liquidity-providing longer-term refinancing operations with a maturity of 12 months. This will further lengthen the', ' management. At the very start of the money market stress in August 2007, the ECB reacted within a few hours and temporarily provided additional liquidity to banks with immediate liquidity needs. We were in fact the first central bank to take non-standard measures. When in mid-September 2008 the crisis intensified and interbank trading came to a virtual halt, the ECB engaged in a new mode of liquidity provision. We started to provide refinancing well above the levels that banks had absorbed to fulfil their reserve requirements in normal times. Our approach comprises three main ‘building blocks’. We significantly adapted our regular refinancing operations. We now follow a ‘fixed rate full allotment’ tender procedure and have significantly expanded the maturity of our operations. Banks have been granted access to essentially unlimited liquidity at our policy interest rate at maturities of, initially, up to six months. This is an exceptional mode of operation. In normal times we auction a given amount of central bank credit and let competition between the bidders determine the interest rate. This unusual mode of operation implies that we currently act as a surrogate for the market in terms of both liquidity allocation and price-setting. Our second building block is the long list of assets that we take as collateral. This list was already very long before the crisis, but we have extended it even further and now accept an even wider range of securities as collateral. The first two building blocks offer unlimited refinancing against a very wide range of collateral. But they can only reach the financial system if they are coupled with the third building block, namely the very large number of counterparties that have always been able to take part in our refinancing operations. Even before the financial crisis, this number was higher than for the other major central banks. Following the changes to our operational framework in October last', 'IA close to the minimum bid rate. As a third measure, the Eurosystem increased the share of refinancing provided via longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs), initially with a three-month maturity and, since April 2008, also with a six–month maturity, and reduced the share provided via the one-week main refinancing operations (MROs). Accordingly, the total amount of outstanding refinancing remained unchanged, while the average maturity was extended. As a result of this liquidity policy, the Eurosystem maintained control over short-term money market rates, supported banks’ access to liquidity and the general functioning of the euro money market, without the need for making any structural change to its operational framework for monetary policy implementation. Some central banks conducted additional actions, which mainly included expanding the range of eligible collateral and of counterparties. The ECB, which had accepted relatively broad ranges of collateral since the start of the euro, did not need to adjust their collateral framework. Indeed, owing to its acceptance of a broad range of collateral as well as the large number of eligible counterparties, the Eurosystem’s collateral framework has been well equipped to support the implementation of monetary policy during the ongoing market turbulence. The share of deposited collateral not used to cover credit from monetary policy operations has remained high. This suggests that availability of collateral has not been a constraint on the Euroystem’s counterparties in the wake of the turmoil. As the turmoil went on, central banks strengthened their cooperation, first through enhanced information exchange and collective monitoring of market developments and later on by coordinated steps to provide liquidity. In response to a situation where some euro area banks were reported to be concerned about the limited availability of funding denominated in US dollars, the ECB agreed with the US Federal Reserve to grant loans in dollars to euro']"

Although political integration proved to be over-ambitious, some visionary political leaders decided, nevertheless, to pursue the path of economic integration. This led to the founding of the European Coal and Steel Community in 1952 and the establishment of the European Economic Community with the Treaty of Rome in 1957. The first step was a customs union among the six founding countries. At the time, probably nobody could have guessed that economic integration would advance through various phases and over such a long period. But the Single European Act followed in 1986 and the “Single Market Programme” in 1992. In short, the Single Market is now becoming a reality. Work on the remaining imperfections of the Single Market is also advancing. We must not forget that this process has required many decades and continuous political support. Why, in the last 50 years, did economic integration face fewer obstacles and actually keep in motion the process of European integration? The main reason is that, from the outset, economic integration removed barriers and thereby secured material and economic benefits. In fact, it has brought widespread benefits by promoting reciprocal trade. Trade in fact has grown by several multiples. Economic integration has also helped to establish a more competitive environment. We must also not forget that economic integration has rendered all EU countries more interdependent than in the past. Under these circumstances, spillovers from national policies could be significant. Each country has a stake in the well-being and, let me say, “good behaviour” of its partners. Given such circumstances, the conviction underlying the Maastricht Treaty was that nominal exchange rates should be irrevocably fixed to achieve and maintain a truly unified', \" it combines functional economic elements with institutional political ones. The single currency does away once and for all with internal exchange rate fluctuations, completes the Single Market and, with a single money (already at the start) for almost 300 million people, increases the efficiency of currency use in an unprecedented manner. The transfer of national currency sovereignty to the European Central Bank represents a partial surrender of political sovereignty, which is rightly perceived by citizens as marking a deep change in the way in which nations consider themselves. For the Federal Republic of Germany, for example, the law on the Deutsche Bundesbank was an important element in the order of the state. The monetary order established by the Maastricht Treaty with the detailed statute of the European System of Central Banks by itself represents an important building block for the development of a European statehood. The following assertion holds true, irrespective of individual opinions on the merit of the project: the success of the European Central Bank's monetary policy and the stability of the euro constitute a test case for European integration above and beyond monetary and currency issues. With the onset of Monetary Union the Maastricht Treaty has created a unique, historical asymmetry. On the one hand, a European, supranational monetary order, yet predominantly national sovereignty in most other areas. This combination creates a tension that will leave its mark on the future integration process. There can be no turning back, as the failure of Monetary Union would not only be extremely costly from an economic point of view, but the political fallout would be unimaginable and would be tantamount to a catastrophe. The brightest and most respected former sceptics have conceded this much and now share the conviction that, once it has been set in motion, European Economic and Monetary Union must not fail. So what does the future hold? Anyone who believes in the role of\", 'Summary of a presentation by Ms Sirkka Hämäläinen, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, The Tore Browaldh lecture 1999, School of Economics and Commercial Law, Göteborg University, Gothenburg, 25 February 1999 The European integration process started shortly after the Second World War and was, at the time, strongly motivated by political factors. The aim was to eliminate the risk that wars and crises would once more plague the continent. The first concrete result was the establishment, in 1952, of the European Coal and Steel Community between six countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands). This was followed by the adoption of the Treaty of Rome in 1957, laying the foundations for the European Economic Community. The first concrete proposal for a Monetary Union was presented in the so-called Werner Report in 1970. The Report was intended to pave the way for the establishment of a Monetary Union in the early 1980s. However, the proposals of the Werner Report were never implemented - being overtaken by world events. After the break-up of the Bretton Woods system and the shock of the first oil crisis in 1973, most western European economies were contaminated by the economic sickness popularly labelled \"Eurosclerosis\", characterised by high inflation and persisting unemployment. At that time, the European economies were protected by regulations and financial markets were still poorly developed. In this environment, it was concluded that a Monetary Union would not be possible and the project was postponed. The idea of establishing Monetary Union was revived only in 1988 and a detailed proposal was presented the following year in the Delors Report, after the launch (in 1985) of the Single Market programme on the free movement of goods, services, capital and labour.

These factors can be jointly illustrated through supply-demand decompositions for goods inflation and services inflation, as is shown in Charts 7 and 8.

And they should eventually pass through to food and core inflation – consistent with the easing in pipeline price pressures (Chart 6). This is compressing medium-term consumer inflation expectations [ 7 ] , and might temper catch-up wage demands. But how quickly these effects will be reflected in the inflation data is uncertain. And concerns about inflation persistence [ 8 ] make projecting core inflation particularly challenging.

At the same time, there has been much less progress in relation to domestic inflation compared to broader inflation measures, reflecting the higher sensitivity of domestic inflation to local cost pressures.

What is the framework in which monetary and exchange rate policy will evolve in the “new” Member States on their way to the eventual adoption of the euro? Upon accession and before ERM II entry, the “new” Member States are required to treat their exchange rate policies as a matter of common interest and pursue price stability as the primary objective of monetary policy. Yet, the full responsibility for monetary and exchange rate policy is still with the “new” Member States. With respect to ERM II participation , there are no formal criteria to be met prior to the entry. Nevertheless, a successful and smooth participation in the mechanism requires that major policy adjustments – for example relating to a sound fiscal policy framework and price liberalisation – are undertaken before joining the mechanism. Depending on the monetary and exchange rate strategies in place, ERM II can help orient macroeconomic policies to stability and anchor inflation expectations. At the same time, the mechanism allows for a degree of flexibility, if needed, through the wide standard fluctuation band and the possibility of adjusting the central parity. Eventually, the “new” Member States are expected to adopt the euro . Let me stress that joining the euro area is a far-reaching step for any country. To be able to join the euro area each country will be assessed on the basis of a deep and precise analysis of their performance with respect to the Maastricht convergence criteria. At the same time, it has to be ensured that the achievements in terms of nominal convergence are sustainable and can be maintained over the long term. So far the progress towards nominal convergence varies widely across the “new” Member States, which implies that the “new” Member States will join the euro area at', ' the Treaty establishing the European Community. This entails that, on their road to the euro, they will, at some point, join the Exchange Rate Mechanism II. ERM II is a multilateral arrangement of fixed, but adjustable, exchange rates with a central rate and a standard fluctuation band of (15% against the euro. Thus, under ERM II, the official use of the euro in its role as an anchor currency by some non-euro area EU Member States will no longer represent a unilateral decision by the respective authorities. Rather, it will be based on a multilateral agreement between the Member State concerned, the euro area member countries, the ECB and the other Member States participating in the mechanism. This is most evident with regard to the decisions on central rates, as they are taken by mutual agreement of the various parties to ERM II. Moreover, several exchange rate regimes are incompatible with ERM II participation, including pegs against anchors other than the euro. The new Member States differ greatly in terms of their economic structures, current exchange rates and monetary regimes, and in the degree of nominal and real convergence already achieved. Thus, no single path towards ERM II and the adoption of the euro can be identified and recommended. Rather, a case-by-case approach – based on the principle of equal treatment – will be followed, in line with the stipulations laid down in the Treaty. This includes the criteria concerning the sustainability of nominal convergence, better known as the “Maastricht criteria”. There will be no additional criteria but there will be no relaxation of the criteria either. We are aware that the road to the euro will be demanding, with participation in ERM II being only one element of the overall policy framework in the process towards full monetary integration. In a document published', ' membership for at least two years. Although there are no formal criteria to be met for entry into ERM II, successful participation in the mechanism requires that major policy adjustments – for example relating to fiscal policy and price liberalisation – are undertaken before joining the mechanism. Participation in ERM II is an important means to anchor exchange rate and inflation expectations and to promote consistently sound policies. It helps to orient macroeconomic policies to stability, while at the same time allowing for a degree of flexibility , if needed, through the wide standard fluctuation band and the possibility of adjusting the central parity. As you know, three new EU countries have in the meantime entered the ERM II : with effect from 28 June 2004, Estonia, Lithuania and Slovenia joined Denmark as participants in the mechanism. The three new entrants joined with a standard fluctuation band of ±15% around their central rates against the euro, while Estonia and Lithuania kept their currency boards as a unilateral commitment. In order to ensure a smooth participation in ERM II, countries have firmly committed to take the necessary measures to preserve macroeconomic and exchange rate stability. Participation in ERM II has been smooth . The four currencies in the ERM II have traded continuously at or close to their central rates , while short-term interest rate differentials vis-à-vis the euro area have been small. Beyond ERM II membership lies the adoption of the euro , the crowning achievement of the monetary integration process. In order to adopt the euro, non-participating EU Member States have to achieve a high degree of sustainable economic and legal convergence. Every country will be assessed on its own merits and its own particular situation, on the basis of a strict analysis of the performance relating to the Maastricht convergence criteria.

         "[' in 2008 Last year, we made a formal commitment to deliver the SEPA instruments, but had no concrete plans. Today, we have three resolutions on SEPA credit transfers, direct debits and cards, which were adopted at the EPC Plenary of 21 September 2005. Thanks to the dedicated efforts of hundreds of bankers, who participated in various working groups over the summer, the EPC has achieved a major milestone by sending the SEPA Direct Debit Scheme and the Credit Transfer Scheme out for national consultation before they will finally be rubberstamped at the EPC December Plenary. Moreover, the SEPA Cards Framework was endorsed by the EPC Plenary at its last meeting. It is now up to the national banking communities to come up with proposals on the way in which national card schemes will comply with this framework. It is clear that the SEPA train is on track and heading towards its first destination. Even though some difficult issues remain to be resolved, the EPC has proved itself in the leadership role that is necessary to ensure the delivery of a SEPA to citizens in 2008. However, in my view, there are some obstacles on the tracks that make the ride on the SEPA train not quite as smooth as it should be. However, these obstacles can be overcome. SEPA for Cards Last year I expressed my wish to see improvements so that cardholders can use their cards in the same way both nationally and within the SEPA from 1 January 2007. In the past year, the EPC has drafted the SEPA Cards Framework. This has not been an easy task, given that, initially, several misconceptions prevailed in the market, for example, that the EPC wanted to set up a new card scheme to compete with Visa and MasterCard! Since then, a lot of work has been done and', ' of SEPA has been improved with the creation of the SEPA Council, which further formalises the involvement of high-level representatives of consumers, retailers, corporations and SMEs in the SEPA dialogue at the European level. Progress has also been observed in the transposition and implementation of the Payment Services Directive and in standardisation. However, there are also areas where developments have been unsatisfactory and greater efforts are required. In some of these areas, much still needs to be done in order to further integrate the euro area retail market. A regulation setting an end date for migration to SEPA There is a need for a realistic but ambitious end date to be set for migration to the SEPA credit transfer and direct debit schemes in order to reap the full benefits of SEPA. Although the potential benefits of the SEPA project are substantial, migration to SEPA cannot be described as fully successful yet. In August 2010 only 9.3% of all euro area credit transfers were processed as SEPA credit transfers, and only a share of well below 1% of all euro area direct debits were processed as SEPA direct debits. On the positive side, in November 2010 adherence and reachability will be ensured for the SEPA direct debit scheme, as banks will be legally obliged to be reachable. A number of public administrations have committed themselves to migrating their payments to SEPA by the end of this year. Still, this will not be sufficient to achieve critical mass as regards migration to SEPA and will not, therefore, bring about a significant increase in the rate of migration. There are several reasons why migration to SEPA has been slow: the prevailing market uncertainty; the difficult economic climate; potential disadvantages for “first movers” in a network industry; and resistance to migrating fully from legacy to SEPA payment', ' has not been an easy process, and there has been some controversy between the European Commission and the financial industry with regard to the contents and coverage of the regulation, particularly the technical requirements for credit transfers and direct debits and the direct debit interchange. The Eurosystem expects the SEPA credit transfer and the SEPA direct debit, which can comply with the technical requirements, to become the credit transfer and direct debit schemes used for euro payments in the EU. Where direct debit interchange is concerned, the draft regulation now provides legal certainty. Despite the controversy, we all share the conviction that determining a clear deadline for migration to the SEPA credit transfer (SCT) and the SEPA direct debit (SDD) is necessary to bring SEPA to a successful conclusion. Thus, I would encourage you to focus on what lies ahead, and not to be dissuaded from pursuing your initiatives and projects. As you know, one of the areas that needs to be driven further forward by the EPC is the standardisation of cards. Last year, Ms Tumpel-Gugerell discussed three elements that are required for a move towards a competitive European payment card market: first, the development of an additional European card scheme; second, the separation of card schemes from processing entities; and third, card standardisation. Progress in the development of an additional card scheme has been considerably slower than hoped for. The slow progress in this area gives further weight and importance to card standardisation, which should ensure interoperability and the harmonised use of cards across Europe. Here, I would like to emphasise that the EPC should provide guidance for standardisation initiatives in the different domains (card-to-terminal, terminal-to-acquirer, acquirer-to-issuer, and certification and type approval) on which standards']"

This is a major improvement, since so far financial stability assessments have been conducted mostly at the national level by central banks and supervisors or have been focused on specific financial sectors. Second, the power of the ESRB to issue risk warnings and policy recommendations to supervisory authorities and other relevant policy-makers should result in concrete actions to prevent or mitigate threats to the stability of the financial system. More generally, macro-prudential oversight will help micro-prudential supervisors to better take into account conjunctural and structural developments in the financial system and the real economy in the supervision of individual financial institutions. The tools required for carrying out the tasks of macro-prudential supervision are of two kinds: analytical tools for risk identification and assessment, and macro-prudential policy instruments. The analytical tools that can be used to identify and assess systemic risks and to issue early risk warnings include: (i) financial stability indicators to point to fragilities related, inter alia, to broad-based increases in leverage or to financial institutions’ rising common exposures to asset classes; (ii) early warning models to indicate when the financial system, or a particular market, approaches a “danger zone”; (iii) macro stress-testing models to assess the resilience of the banking system to extreme but plausible events; and (iv) contagion models to help identify the extent to which financial sectors are interconnected. A substantial amount of work is being carried out at the ECB and elsewhere to improve these analytical tools. As the financial system is both complex and evolving, the tools for macro-prudential analysis must be constantly evaluated and possibly adapted accordingly. Of course', 'prudential supervision, which looks at the stability of individual financial institutions. Macroprudential supervision in the euro area: The European Systemic Risk Board Macroprudential oversight will be the key task of the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), which is built on the proposals of the High Level Group chaired by Jacques de Larosière. The European Commission’s legislative proposals for the establishment and functioning of the ESRB have received the support by the ECOFIN and the EU Council. The European Parliament is currently considering the proposals in its turn. Let me also mention that the ECB/Eurosystem expressed its stance in the opinion adopted on 26 October. 2009 It welcomed the broad agreement reached by ECOFIN on the draft legal texts regarding the establishment of the ESRB and the involvement of the ECB in supporting the ESRB. As stated in its Opinion, the ECB has decided that it stands ready to provide the analytical, statistical, administrative and logistical support to the ESRB, including the Secretariat of the ESRB. What will be the activities of the ESRB and what is its value added? The ESRB will be expected to actively monitor the various sources of risk to financial stability in the EU – across countries and across financial sectors, and also taking into account global developments. As a result of this monitoring, the ESRB can identify the risks and analyse in-depth how they could impact the financial system. Stress-testing and other methodologies could assist the risk prioritisation exercise. The value-added to be provided by the ESRB is to link, in particular, macro-economic conditions, structural developments, and key vulnerabilities of financial institutions. This will permit to identify system-wide risks for the benefit of regulatory and supervisory policies. The monitoring,', ' the resilience of this market. So how exactly will the new discipline of macroprudential oversight be conducted? Financial stability is not an issue exclusively for central banks. Micro-prudential supervisors have a key role, because stable institutions are an essential and necessary condition for achieving financial stability. This is why the ESAs and national supervisors together with the central banks are members of the ESRB and why the ESRB and the ESAs form the European System of Financial Supervisors. The ESRB’s main tasks are threefold: to identify and prioritise systemic risks; to issue early warnings when significant systemic risks emerge; and to issue policy recommendations for remedial action in response to the risks it identifies. The ESRB will not focus on individual institutions, individual countries or individual macroeconomic issues – it will take a strong horizontal focus, across countries, across sectors and across the boundaries between the financial sphere and the real economy. Interlinkages and spillovers should be key terms in its analysis. To achieve these tasks, the ESRB is drawing on information from many sources, including strong analytical input from its members; intelligence gathered from financial system participants; and the data necessary to understand the nature of interlinkages that define the financial system. ESRB analysis must be broad-based covering potentially any aspect of the EU’s financial system – markets, institutions and infrastructure. The ESRB is being established at a time when the concerns of markets and policy-makers about short-term vulnerabilities seem to prevail over perceptions of medium- and longer-term risks. This confronts the ESRB, as well as other macroprudential bodies around the world, with specific challenges. The ESRB needs to consider what activities to initiate, well before a fully-fledged macropr']"

The volatility of the euro area aggregate is clearly a second-best solution both from a monetary policy perspective and in terms of the effectiveness and efficiency of the statistics concerned. Within the statistical community of the ESCB, a shift in emphasis towards a truly European team spirit is already taking place . For instance, when the ECB releases its monthly statistics on monetary developments in the euro area, the national central banks (NCBs) publish the results for their respective country shortly afterwards. I am convinced that the European Statistical System – comprising of Eurostat, the Statistical Office of the European Communities, and the National Statistical Institutes (NSIs) – will want to follow suit. The harmonisation of the methodologies used by the various countries for the collection and production of statistics lies at the heart of a monetary union: it enables us, for example, to compile meaningful area-wide aggregates. At the same time, the fruitful and fairly detailed statistical harmonisation achieved in the euro area may inspire the further development of worldwide statistical standards. Given that cross-country comparability of official statistics is key to their usefulness and credibility , all countries across the globe should then want to implement such worldwide standards in their official economic and financial statistics. Of course, this applies a fortiori to external statistics , such as the trade balance, the balance of payments and the international investment position, where we still have a lot of progress to make. Partner countries will only be able to share a common analysis of their bilateral economic and financial relationships if their mutual external statistics mirror each other. In turn, this is only feasible if these statistics are compiled using the same concepts and definitions, and similar methodologies. In view of their importance for policy-making, it may be', ' the following five lines of action , as my colleagues will explain to you in more detail later today: Firstly , since the beginning of the crisis the ESCB has enriched several datasets in order to close the most urgent gaps within monetary and financial statistics.

Secondly , the ESCB has since 2009 been preparing the compilation of balance of payments statistics and sector accounts including financial accounts in line with the latest international statistical standards and has also been publishing the results since the fourth quarter of 2014. Thirdly , the ECB has been collecting, in addition to security-by-security data on issuances, information on holdings in recent years. Securities holdings represent a field where exposures are often concentrated and a lack of sufficiently comprehensive, consistent and granular information has been identified. The aim of developing a detailed dataset on securities holdings is to combine large concentrated holdings in the euro area with information on the individual issuers across the world, as contained in the Centralised Securities Database. Fourthly , the efforts that have been made to collect more granular data from banks and other agents take into account the reporting burden. The idea is that granular data are stepwise only reported once and are used for several purposes. The reporting burden on the reporting agents is thereby reduced, saving resources and costs. Timely granular data are also key to addressing in a smooth and effective manner ever-changing user needs, and also to reducing the need for costly ad hoc data requests. In any case, all data collections by the ESCB are subject to a prior, strict merits-and-costs procedure in order to minim', ' are clear advantages in ensuring that international statistical and accounting standards are harmonised to the fullest extent possible. Such harmonisation will enable the same source data to be used for several purposes. This will increase the reliability of the macroeconomic statistics and will reduce the reporting burden for corporations. Similar consistency and efficiency gains are possible for the government sector. In this respect the Directorate General Statistics of the ECB is participating in an international initiative to align government accounting practices with international statistical standards. In general, statisticians should be closely involved in discussions on accounting standards in order to avoid unnecessary deviations between these standards and the statistical requirements. My third topic looks at universities and researchers. Economic and financial statistics, and in particular national accounts, are an integral part of economic studies, just as business accounting is an integral part of business administration. It is astonishing that in Europe, at least, the number of graduates and post-graduates with an advanced education in economic and financial statistics is not only insufficient, but is actually decreasing. There is a need to reflect the growing importance of official statistics for a global economy better in university courses. Similarly, researchers may find it attractive to contribute to the further development and application of international statistical standards and their alignment with the international accounting rules, to a better presentation of statistics including the development of quality indicators or to a more efficient compilation of euro area data. The Directorate General Statistics of the ECB will be happy to co-operate closely with a select group of interested researchers at the leading edge of official statistics for a global economy. Conclusion In conclusion, the development of European economic and financial statistics has been so remarkable in the past ten years that I am tempted to call it a \"silent revolution\". I would even say that European Monetary Union itself would not be possible without those developments in the statistical field. However, this silent']"

         "[' developments. In particular, it has been shown that periods of high money and credit growth often give rise to boom-bust cycles in stock and property prices, which then causes high costs in terms of macroeconomic stability. Overall, we have several tools which could help us to detect bubble phenomena. While individual tools are subject to caveats, applying a broad range of methodologies should help limit the risk of making mistakes in the assessment of asset prices. 4.2 What can central banks do about bubbles? Coming to my second question, how should central banks react if they see the risk of an emerging asset price bubble? The options range from not reacting at all to consciously trying to prick an emerging bubble. Obviously, attempts to deflate an asset price bubble are likely to require substantial interest rate increases which, in turn, could adversely affect economic activity and inflation. In view of the difficulties in identifying a bubble, it seems established wisdom today that central banks should be exceedingly careful in dealing with asset bubbles. There is, however, a more subtle way: to cautiously consider “leaning against the wind” when an asset price bubble is developing. Indeed, some academics have argued that, by accepting some short-term deviation from the pursuit of its stated objective of price stability, a central bank may improve the conditions for maintaining price stability over the medium to long-term. If a potentially costly bubble is firmly under way, then a somewhat tighter monetary policy stance than would otherwise be needed could be warranted. Certainly, there are also risks involved in “leaning against the wind”. First, as I have already mentioned, there can never be full certainty as to whether an asset price bubble is under way. Second, by influencing market psychology, a monetary policy tightening could trigger dynamics that are difficult to foresee and may be hard to', ', in times of market euphoria, the policy rate might have to be raised quite significantly in order to have a measurable effect on booming asset prices. When taken seriously, these considerations lead to doubts about the effectiveness and efficiency of an active “leaning against the wind” approach. A fourth argument basically refers to cost-benefit considerations. In essence, the argument postulates that the costs of \"cleaning up afterwards\" (namely by loosening the monetary policy stance after the bust) are smaller than the \"collateral damage\" of a leaning against the wind approach pursued during the boom. These considerations describe the so-called “cleaning-up strategy” I mentioned earlier. In essence, these arguments all reflect valid concerns and cannot be easily dismissed. More recently, however, a number of arguments have given reason for a tempering of the concerns I have just expressed and have lent support to a “leaning against the wind” approach to asset price bubbles. First of all, with regard to the welfare implications of “leaning against the wind”, the analysis of the costs of boom/bust cycles in asset prices in developed economies has been deepened and refined. Existing theoretical models use fairly specific assumptions to allow for bubbles in general equilibrium, and tend to neglect important aspects which make bubbles costly in the real world. Admittedly, not all boom/bust cycles are detrimental and have significant real effects. This is also one of the reasons why the mechanical targeting of asset prices is not a sensible option for monetary policy. However, the experience of the recent financial crisis ‑ which has been accompanied by sharp declines in global economic activity and increasing unemployment in advanced economies ‑ is a vivid reminder that there are boom/bust cycles which have the potential to trigger systemic crises and', ' some degree ameliorate the moral hazard problem of the purely reactive approach to asset price boom-bust cycles. By reacting more symmetrically – i.e. being tighter in booms as well as looser in busts – the central bank would discourage excessive risk-taking and thereby reduce over-investment already during the boom. This in turn would lead to a lower level of indebtedness and less severe consequences of a possible future bust. Thus, despite this property, the leaning against the wind principle faces some other intricate issues. First of all, bubbles – and asset price misalignments in general – may have their roots in underlying structural imbalances. Policies designed to effectively deal with these structural causes, such as prudential regulation or changes to the tax code, could be optimal and preferred in many cases. One should also take into account how and the extent to which a leaning against the wind policy can affect the markets. For example, it could be argued that for a small open economy leaning against the wind with regard to equity price bubbles is infeasible. With globalised equity markets, it is unlikely that the central bank of a small open economy would have the clout to affect domestic share prices against a global trend. On the other hand, a disorderly market reaction to a policy intervention can never be completely ruled out, even in cases where the policy is implemented gradually over an extended time horizon. In my opinion, while such a policy is compelling in many theoretical aspects, in practice (barring the progress represented by recent research findings on the prediction of financial crises mentioned earlier) it is likely that the circumstances in which a policy-maker will embark with confidence upon an explicit leaning against the wind policy will occur rarely.

Successful central bank communication supports predictability and correct price formation in financial markets, contributes to the efficient allocation of funds and reduces uncertainty about future interest rates. A reasonable understanding of the monetary policy strategy among the public helps to guide price and wage-setting behaviour in a manner consistent with the objectives of the central bank. In the case of the ECB, it was understood at an early stage that external communication would be very important. In this respect, the publication of the key elements of the monetary policy strategy in October 1998 and the communication of the details of its clarification in 2003 constituted in themselves a major step towards monetary policy transparency. In the practical implementation of our communication we make use of a wide range of channels. I will mention only two of these here: First, we hold a press conference after the first Governing Council meeting in each month. The introductory statement at this press conference is a key element of our communication, as it conveys the collective view of the ECB’s Governing Council on the monetary policy stance in real time. Second, there is the ECB’s Monthly Bulletin, which is published one week after the press conference. It gives a more detailed explanation of the analysis behind the monetary policy decisions, as well as regularly reporting on information collected by the ECB, such as the bank lending survey or the Survey of Professional Forecasters. Importantly, it also includes the quarterly projections, an advance copy of which is published immediately after the press conference following the Governing Council meeting. The Monthly Bulletin also contains articles providing insights into the principles governing our policy. It is this combination of a full and transparent presentation of the monetary policy concept and strategy,', ' press conference immediately after the meeting of the Governing Council. In an introductory statement I explain our decisions and on what basis we have taken them. This is followed by a question and answer session with a large number of journalists. Both the introductory statement and the questions and answers are published on our Web site, almost without delay. I believe this arrangement is both a unique and - from our perspective - demanding one. In addition, we publish a Monthly Bulletin in all 11 official languages of the European Union. We publish an Annual Report and there are many speeches, interviews and publications. At quarterly intervals I appear at a hearing before the European Parliament. Nobody should doubt our intention to be open and transparent. Unfortunately, the debate on this issue has often focused on our practice of not publishing the minutes of Governing Council meetings. In substance my introductory statements are not so different from what other central banks would call minutes. And they are published immediately. As to the substance of what we publish, two issues remain. First, we do not reveal voting records for several reasons. As I said, the Governing Council is a collegiate body. What is relevant are the final decisions of that body and the underlying arguments, not the individual positions. Publishing individual positions can easily distract from what is really important. What is of paramount importance in the European context is that members of the Governing Council do not represent a particular country or their national central bank and that decisions should always be based on euro area-wide considerations. This is a new principle and everything should be done to ensure that it is adhered to. Publishing voting records could easily lead to placing monetary policy debates in a national context and even to putting pressure on individual Council members. The second issue is that, for the time being, we do not publish our economic forecasts, including our inflation', \" accountability. Most importantly, the President will hold an extensive press conference immediately following the first Governing Council meeting of every month. A thorough assessment of the economic environment together with special articles on topical issues are also provided in a Monthly Bulletin. The first issue of the Bulletin appeared last week. In addition, there will be working papers and occasional papers presenting the analysis and research conducted by ECB staff for scientific review. The members of the Executive Board and other members of the Governing Council will further communicate with the public very actively through regular speeches and interviews. The decision by the Governing Council of the ECB not to publish the minutes of its meetings and not to make public the voting behaviour of its members has been criticised in some quarters as a lack of accountability and transparency. In this context, one should recall that, for the purpose of accountability, what matters most will be the ECB's actual track record of stability performance. Moreover, the Governing Council will strive for a maximum degree of accountability and transparency regarding its operation as a collegiate/collective body and not with respect to individual members. For that purpose it is essential to convey to the public a sense of the reasoning behind the decisions of the Governing Council and a coherent summary of the information upon which decisions are based. On the occasions of the President's press conferences, a detailed assessment of the economic situation and the outlook for price developments will be given every month followed by a question and answer session. A summary of all relevant information that would normally be expected to be contained in published minutes will therefore - for all practical purposes - be immediately available, together with an opportunity to pose further questions. This goes far beyond what most central banks are prepared to do in terms of communicating with the public. It is not quite obvious to my mind that the legitimate and important cause of transparency would be\"]"

The children\\'s competition and the advertising campaign are key elements of the Euro 2002 Information Campaign\\'s comprehensive information and education programme. With the support of the communications agency, Publicis, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the 12 national central banks of the euro area have been conducting the campaign since mid-2000, with the campaign slogan \" the EURO. OUR money \". Our information campaign concentrates on four main areas: the visual appearance of the euro banknotes and coins; their main security features; the denominations of the euro banknotes and coins; and the changeover process. In order to reach such a broad public, we have developed partnerships with more than 3,000 national and international organisations. Our partners in both the public and private sector are using our information material on the euro banknotes and coins to broaden their audience and multiply the impact of our information campaign. National euro conferences have been organised and hosted by the national central banks throughout the euro area to bring together these partners and other key participants in order to spread the use of \"best practices\" in preparing both the general public and cash handlers for the 1 January changeover. On key dates throughout the year we have been providing the media with press kits.

The NCBs of the Eurosystem will implement the information campaign on a decentralised basis. The Eurosystem\\'s campaign will address all users of the euro, including users from outside the euro area, namely tourists, travellers and nationals from countries where the euro circulates widely as a parallel currency. In order to reach such a broad public, the information campaign will use relevant groups or institutions as partners or \"multipliers\", such as banks, retailers, educational institutions, the media, etc. Particular attention will be paid to vulnerable groups, such as the elderly, the handicapped, the deaf, and the blind and partially sighted, who will need tailor-made information. Our information campaign will be co-ordinated with other campaigns prepared by national authorities. The idea is to complement other euro campaigns. Our campaign can thus be considered a \"specialised\" campaign. The message will concentrate on four main issues: the detailed visual appearance of the banknotes and coins, their main security features, the euro banknote denominations and the changeover modalities. An information campaign mainly focused on the details of the banknotes and coins cannot start too early. It would be very difficult and costly to try to keep the public\\'s attention for a long period of time. Moreover, in order to limit the risks of counterfeiting, the security features and other details of the banknotes should not be unveiled too early, namely not before 1 September 2001, the earliest delivery date for frontloading. Therefore, the bulk of the information campaign, in particular the mass media part, will take place during the last four months of next year but also in the first weeks of 2002, when the changeover will take place and the', ' which comprises around 300 million citizens, is in many respects a huge challenge. First, by the end of 2001, the Eurosystem will have produced around 16 billion euro banknotes, some 15 billion of which will already have been produced by the end of November, i.e. far more than the approximately 10 billion requested to replace the national banknotes currently in circulation. In addition, around 50 billion euro coins are to be produced. The banknotes are produced by 15 different printing works throughout the European Union. The euro banknotes are being produced with state-of-the-art security standards and combine many of the highly effective security features already used in the national banknotes of the euro area Member States, together with some additional features. Second, the banking sector, security carriers, retailers and the cash-operating machine industry needed to be closely involved both in the preparations and in the process itself at an early stage, since a smooth cash changeover can only be achieved in a short period of time through systematic and co-ordinated interaction on the part of all the main participants. In order to ensure the smooth introduction of the euro banknotes and coins, the logistics of the 2002 cash changeover were determined well in advance; this has allowed enough time for all those concerned to undertake the necessary preparations. Third, the successful introduction of euro cash needs to be preceded by a goal-oriented information campaign to prepare the general public and professional cash handlers in Europe for the new currency. Information is certainly a fundamental prerequisite for the success of the euro cash changeover. In order to ensure a smooth and fluid replacement of the national banknotes and coins with euro banknotes and coins, euro area citizens must appreciate the benefits to be derived from this operation which, in a nutshell, represents the culmination of the process of European monetary integration']"

These changes in national monetary legislation or at least the practice of central bank independence were beginning to be implemented well before the start of the Maastricht process. They were, however, further promoted by the recommendations of the Delors Committee with regard to the institutional arrangements for Stage Three of Monetary Union. The Committee\\'s proposals culminated in the inclusion in the Maastricht Treaty and the Statute of the ESCB of the primary objective of price stability, the pursuit of which is delegated to an independent central bank system composed of the ECB and the national central banks of Member States. 2. The independence and accountability of the ESCB The Treaty (in Article 107) and the Statute of the ESCB (in Article 7) both contain very clear provisions regarding the relationship with third parties, which leave no room whatsoever for misinterpretation. To quote a key sentence: \"neither the ECB, nor a national central bank, nor any member of their decision-making bodies shall seek or take instructions from Community institutions or bodies, from any government of a Member State or from any other body\". Moreover, the aforementioned authorities shall also - and I quote again - \"undertake to respect this principle and not to seek to influence the members of the decision-making bodies of the ECB or of the national central banks in the performance of their tasks\". To put it simply: the door to the single monetary policy is locked from both sides, and neither the ESCB nor third parties can open the door for political instructions. Even attempts to do so would already be in conflict with the provisions of the Treaty and the Statute of the ESCB. For national central banks to become an integral part of the ESCB, Member States have to ensure that national legislation is compatible with the Treaty (Article 108) and the Statute of', 'Ladies and gentlemen, The topic of central bank independence has received renewed attention in recent years. Today, I will present the institutional set-up that underpins central bank independence in Europe, as well as accountability and transparency, since these things go hand in hand. Central bank independence in the European System of Central Banks I will start with the principles of independence and accountability that apply in the central banking context – which we have to differentiate from the supervisory one. The legal foundation of central bank independence, which applies to both the ECB and the national central banks (NCBs), is established at the highest possible level in European law. It is enshrined in primary law, in the form of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and the Statute of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) and of the ECB. Since primary EU law can only be modified with the agreement of all (currently 28) Member States, this independence enjoys quasi-constitutional status. ECB independence consists of four important pillars – institutional, functional, personal and financial independence. [ 1 ] Article 130 of the Treaty is the most important provision from the perspective of independence, guaranteeing institutional independence . [ 2 ] It works in two ways. First, it prohibits the ECB, the NCBs and the members of their decision-making bodies from seeking or taking instructions from EU institutions or bodies, from any Member State government or from any other body when exercising the powers and carrying out the tasks and duties conferred upon them by the Treaties. Second, it stipulates that EU and national authorities must respect this independence and not seek to influence the members of the ECB’s or the NCBs’ decision-making bodies in the performance of their tasks. The second pillar of independence is functional independence. The ECB has been given the autonomy to', ' the Treaty; their tenure is 8 years and their dismissal on grounds of either inability or serious misconduct is pronounced by the CJEU. The national laws for appointing governors, who in their personal capacity are members of the Governing Council, are to be compatible with the Statute of the ESCB. The reasons for dismissal are the same as for the members of the Executive Board and subject to the CJEU’s scrutiny as soon as there is knowledge of material evidence of such a procedure. Their terms of office must be 5 years at a minimum. Financial independence is so important that it is explicitly listed in Article 282(3) of the Treaty, which provides that the ECB is independent with regard to the management of its finances, meaning budgetary autonomy and ensuring that the ECB has sufficient capital, staff and income to perform independently the tasks conferred on it by the Treaty and the Statute of the ESCB. [ 14 ] In addition, Article 14.4 of the Statute of the ESCB provides the Governing Council with a veto power to object to national functions/actions of NCBs that interfere with the objectives and tasks of the ESCB, thus further safeguarding, among other things, central bank financial independence. The NCBs cannot assume tasks that would endanger their ability, from a financial perspective, to carry out ESCB-related tasks. Regarding the nature and the scope of the independence granted to the ECB, it is worth emphasising the CJEU’s understanding that the broad concept of independence that the ECB enjoys, and which Article 130 of the Treaty is intended to protect its monetary function. Some scholars and one national court [ 15 ] have been even stricter in their interpretation, arguing that the independence of central banks is an exception to the principle of democratic legitimacy. This exception allows an independent institution outside the normal']"

This will cover issues like the methodology for the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP), off-site and on-site reviews, risk assessments and model validations. We are thereby ensuring that the same supervisory standards will be applied across Banking Union – and indeed, through harmonisation with the European Banking Authority, across the EU as a whole. In terms of decision-making, we are strengthening the centre by integrating the European and national levels of supervision. A particular innovation here will be the Joint Supervisory Teams, which will contain staff from both the ECB and the national competent authorities. There will be one team for each significant banking group directly supervised by the SSM, operating under the management of a coordinator working for the ECB. This guarantees a collective approach and ensures that there will always be a European element in the decision-making. Indeed, the final responsibility for decisions will rest with the ECB. This process of creating an integrated SSM is of course a major organisational challenge. We are bringing together 17 or more different national supervisors, with different operating cultures and supervisory philosophies, into a single mechanism with a single culture and philosophy. And the ECB will be directly hiring around 1,000 new staff, of which around 750 will be involved in supervision. So it will take time to reach our cruising speed. With the SSM Regulation foreseen to enter into force at the beginning of November, we are ready to publish the vacancy notice for the Chair of the Supervisory Board, followed by those for the top management of the SSM – the four Directors General of the main departments and the six Deputy Directors General. The vacancy notices for the middle management will follow a few weeks', ' structures or “national champions” were in the interest of the respective taxpayers. The elimination of potential national bias is therefore key. Implementation of the European dimension depends on several elements. The first is the appropriate scoping of participating jurisdictions. The establishment of the SSM will bring all banks established in the euro area, and the credit institutions established in those Member States which have entered into a close cooperation with the ECB, under the supervision of the ECB. This creates a level playing field. Whereas only the most significant banks will fall under the direct supervision of the ECB, less significant banks, while remaining under national supervision, will not be excluded from the ECB’s supervisory reach. National authorities will have to abide by ECB regulations, guidelines and general instructions and be subject to the ECB’s broad oversight mandate over the functioning of the SSM. To ensure the consistent application of supervisory standards, the ECB may decide at any time to exercise direct supervision on less significant credit institutions. The possibility for non-euro area Member States to join the SSM emphasises the EU-wide dimension. This also implies that they will have to adhere to the guidelines and instructions issued by the ECB. The design envisaged for the SSM is based on building a strong centre, supported by an adequate allocation of tasks between centre and periphery. The responsibility and decision-making power for the overall functioning of the system will be held by the ECB. Its efficient operationalisation, however, will depend on the national competent authorities, whose expertise and proximity to the supervised entities are essential in ensuring that no aspect is overlooked. Even in the case of banks directly supervised by the ECB, experts from national authorities will be involved in on-site inspections. These and other operations should be conducted in the context of joint supervisory teams headed by ECB', ' acts effectively, efficiently and pre-emptively, brings together experience and knowledge of regional and European markets and of supervisory parameters, monitors European and global developments, identifies risk trends and finds quickly mitigating measures, and contributes to setting European and global standards. The SSM is one of the world’s largest supervisors. We supervise 123 significant banking groups in 19 countries, including nine out of the current 30 global systemically important banks identified for 2016. We are also responsible for the effective and consistent function of the SSM, which includes overseeing about 3,500 less significant institutions. The total assets under SSM supervision amount to more than €26 trillion. SSM supervision is conducted by thousands of supervisors across Europe, most of whom work for the 26 national supervisory authorities. The last 12 to 18 months were marked by a whole series of measures, including: recruiting more than 1,000 ECB supervisors and support staff; setting up central supervisory infrastructures; carrying out the comprehensive assessment and translating the results into supervisory actions; developing and implementing the SSM’s legal and methodological framework; setting up the Joint Supervisory Teams and establishing a consistent and standardised database; identifying key risks within Europe’s banking sector, drawing up our strategic plan for 2015 and planning our supervisory activities accordingly; enhancing our supervisory methodology further, in particular regarding the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP); harmonising supervisory approaches and perspectives, going beyond options and national discretions; gaining an overview of the 19 national banking sectors with their 3,500 less significant banks; and conducting day-to-day supervision of the 123 banking groups with 1,100 directly supervised banks. All in all, in our first year of operation we have laid the foundation for tough and fair supervision. And I']"

A core element of the regulatory reform was the complete revision of the Basel II framework (now commonly referred to as Basel III) that has been recently agreed by the members of the Basel Committee and endorsed by the Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision. The key elements of the new framework include: (i) a new definition of regulatory capital that will improve both the quality and consistency of the capital base, (ii) the introduction of capital conservation buffer requirements that would constitute an additional layer of protection for banks, especially in periods of excessive credit growth, (iii) the strengthening of the risk coverage of the capital framework that would represent a revision of the prudential rules on securitisation and trading book activities as well as the counterparty credit risk framework, (iv) the planned introduction of a non-risk based leverage ratio that would serve as a supplementary measure to the risk-based requirements to contain the build-up of excessive leverage and address model risks associated with the risk-based capital framework, and (v) the development of a liquidity risk framework that would aim at improving the resilience to liquidity shocks of the banks. The new measures will be introduced over a transition period of 8 years, and have been calibrated with the aim of avoiding severe implications for the national banking system, while supporting economic recovery [ 2 ] . III.2 “Too large” and non-transparent financial sectors? Turning to the developments in the banking sector, let me recall that the size of the financial systems dramatically increased during the past few decades both in Europe and in the US. [ 3 ] To judge whether the financial sector has grown “too large”, it is crucial to answer the question of', ' European Union has been a frontrunner in a number key areas. Three areas in which much progress has been made are: credit rating agencies, hedge funds and compensation practices . As regards credit rating agencies , a new EU regulation subjecting such agencies to mandatory registration and oversight in order to increase transparency and reduce conflicts of interest in the rating process has already entered into force in December 2009. As for hedge funds , the European Commission has proposed a Directive on alternative investment fund managers. This proposal, which is currently under debate, provides that alternative investment fund managers be subject to authorisation and harmonised regulatory standards, including minimum capital as well as disclosure requirements. On compensation practices , the European Commission was among the first to incorporate in a Directive proposal the Principles developed by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) for sound compensation practices, with a projected implementation date of end-2010. In this context, the EU was leading the international agenda in developing further guidance to align compensation practices with long-term value creation and discourage excessive risk-taking in the short-term. To recall, the G20 leaders in Pittsburgh in September endorsed the FSB implementation standards that aim to defer bonus payments, disallow guaranteed bonuses, and introduce a claw-back clause. Recent proposals on how to strengthen the prudential framework In addition, agreement has been reached globally on a comprehensive set of measures to strengthen the prudential framework in response to the crisis. In the EU, the Commission’s proposal for an amendment of the Capital Requirements Directive of July 2009 includes the internationally agreed stricter requirements for trading book and re-securitisations . Moreover, the recently issued proposals of the Basel Committee aim at improving the quality, consistency and transparency of capital for credit institutions as well as developing a framework for liquidity risk . As a consequence, the quality of capital, especially', ' the Basel Committee aim at improving the quality, consistency and transparency of capital for credit institutions as well as developing a framework for liquidity risk . As a consequence, the quality of capital, especially the so called Tier-1 capital which is of utmost importance for loss-absorption on going concern and crisis situations, will significantly improve. The risk coverage of capital requirements will be further strengthened for the counterparty risk related to derivatives, repos and securities financing activities , and incentives will be increased to move OTC derivative exposures to central counterparties and exchanges. A leverage ratio will be introduced as a supplementary measure to the Basel II risk control framework to curb excessive balance sheet growth and to safeguard against model risk and measurement error. Capital buffers and forward-looking provisioning will be introduced to mitigate the inherent procyclical nature of financial activities. Finally, a global minimum liquidity risk standard for internationally active banks will be put in place, requiring banks to hold sufficient high-quality liquid assets to withstand financial stress. These proposed measures have the support of the Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision, who requested the Committee to deliver a fully calibrated and finalised package of reforms by the end of 2010. The Commission envisages the timely incorporation of the aforementioned upcoming regulatory changes in the EU framework. Recent developments in European prudential framework Finally, international cooperation has been strongly reinforced and supervisory colleges for large complex financial groups have been established. At EU level, the setting up and functioning of colleges is provided for in the EU regulatory framework and is well advanced. Looking ahead, legislative proposals should fully reflect the ongoing work at international and EU level aiming at enhancing the resilience of the financial system and protect consumers and investors against the impact of excessive risk taking and irresponsible market practices.

         "[' age. The proposed measures would ensure that Europeans are free to choose how they make their everyday payments. A public option would always be available – in the form of both cash and digital euro – alongside private digital means of payment. At the same time, nobody would be required to hold or pay with digital euro, and users would always be able to decide what they use it for. At the ECB, our investigation phase is now in its final stage, preparing the ground for the Governing Council to decide whether to move to the next phase of the project. Without prejudice to the ECB opinion that we are going to issue on the proposal, I will start by discussing some key aspects of the legislative proposal. I will then update you on the status of the project and outline the next steps. A digital euro that is available to everyone, everywhere, free of charge The legislative proposals on the digital euro and the legal tender status of cash would ensure that, in an increasingly digital world, central bank money remains easily accessible and accepted throughout the euro area. Cash is here to stay. The proposals would enshrine this in legislation. But alongside cash, there would be a new form of central bank money: the digital euro. The proposal on the legal tender status of cash is the most important European-level legislative initiative on cash since euro banknotes were first issued more than 20 years ago. It would strengthen the status of cash and the rights of those who wish to use it. The publication of the proposals was a landmark first step. It will now be up to the European legislators to shape the proposals and ensure that a digital euro would replicate key characteristics of cash in the digital sphere. It would do so by offering a means of electronic payment that is available to everyone, everywhere, free of charge, while guaranteeing the highest level of privacy', \", it needs to be designed in a way that meets people's privacy expectations. We seek to ensure high standards of privacy for digital euro users. But full anonymity – such as offered by cash – does not appear a viable option in my opinion. It would contravene other public policy objectives such as ensuring compliance with anti-money laundering rules and combating the financing of terrorism. And it would also make it virtually impossible to limit the use of the digital euro as a form of investment – for example via holding limits or tiered remuneration – for which identities of users need to be known. We should at least provide a level of privacy equal to that of current electronic payment solutions. But I think it would be desirable to depart from this baseline in certain circumstances. For example, we are exploring together with the European Commission whether the digital euro could replicate some cash-like features and enable greater privacy for low-value - low-risk payments, including for offline payments. Ultimately, finding the right balance between the social value of privacy and the public interest in preventing illicit activities is a political choice and is for the co-legislators to define. Legal tender status The second aspect is the legal tender status. Although an acceptance obligation has to be weighed against principles such as contractual freedom and competition, we should bear in mind that it is a constitutional feature of cash - as central bank money - to be legal tender. And it would be unprecedented to issue central bank money for retail payments without legal tender status - just because it circulates electronically. Moreover, a positive side-effect of a legal tender status may be that it facilitates network effects, allowing citizen to have the option to “pay anywhere” and easily access the digital euro. Indeed, the digital euro can only act as a monetary anchor if it becomes a convenient\", ' would be an electronic means of payment, issued by the central bank and accessible to everyone in the euro area. A digital euro would complement cash – not replace it – by allowing central bank money to also be used in digital form. This would expand the availability of digital central bank money beyond its current use – for transactions between banks – to also include everyone’s daily payments. Introducing a digital euro would ensure that citizens can continue to trust in the monetary anchor behind their digital payments. It would protect the strategic autonomy of European payments and monetary sovereignty, providing a fall-back solution if geopolitical tensions intensify. A digital euro would also help to avoid market dominance, improve the efficiency of the payment system and foster innovation in the private sector. We could, for instance, allow intermediaries to offer innovative services based on the digital euro. This would make it easier to quickly roll out payment solutions across the entire euro area, and for smaller firms to offer more advanced services at competitive prices. Only a widely accepted digital euro can make a difference But the digital euro can only be successful if it becomes part of the everyday lives of Europeans. It must add value compared with existing solutions. What will that take? It is too early to decide on the details of the design. We expect to complete the investigation phase of our digital euro project in the autumn of 2023. But some key principles are already clear. First, a digital euro must respond to the needs of its users. Research has shown that what users value most is wide acceptance, ease of use, low costs, high speed, security and consumer protection. Meanwhile, merchants, who also seek low costs and ease of use, want the digital euro to be integrated with existing systems. Second, a digital euro should also benefit people who so far have limited access to digital payments and']"

         "[' what price stability means. In the context of its stability-oriented monetary policy strategy, the Governing Council of the ECB defined price stability as \"a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the euro area of below 2%\". According to this definition, price stability \"is to be maintained over the medium term\". The phrase \"below 2%\" clearly delineates the upper bound for the rate of measured inflation in the HICP, which is consistent with price stability. At the same time, the use of the word \"increase\" in the definition clearly signals that deflation, i.e. prolonged declines in the level of the HICP, would not be deemed consistent with price stability. The main reason for not aiming at a measured inflation rate of zero is what is known as the \"measurement bias\", which can exist in consumer price indices. These biases arise mainly from changing spending patterns and quality improvements in those goods and services which are included in the basket used to define a specific price index. Such biases cannot always be fully corrected in the construction of price indices. The measurement bias typically causes consumer price indices (CPIs) to overstate slightly the \"true\" rate of inflation. While the measurement bias of the HICP is likely to be lower than that observed in the national CPIs of the countries comprising the euro area, we cannot completely neglect it. Nevertheless, there are as yet no conclusive studies on the size of the measurement bias of the HICP for the euro area. This is the main reason why the Governing Council of the ECB did not announce an explicit lower bound for its definition of price stability. In the literature there are also some economic arguments in favour of a slightly positive rate of inflation. First, it has', \" euro area economy. The evidence provided by experts and academics confirms and even strengthens the conclusion that departures from price stability entail substantial distortions and welfare costs, which manifest themselves thorough various channels. In short, maintaining price stability is the contribution of monetary policy to sustainable growth, job creation and social cohesion. Price stability is a necessary condition to attain those goals. 2.2 The ECB's definition of price stability To make the Treaty mandate operational, the Governing Council of the ECB has provided a quantitative definition of price stability . Price stability is defined as a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the euro area as a whole of below 2%. By referring to increases in the HICP it was made clear from the beginning, in 1998, that deflation is excluded from the definition of price stability. The Governing Council also specified that price stability is to be maintained over the medium term. In the light of past experience, it is clear that the announcement of the quantitative definition of price stability was an extremely valuable element of the ECB's strategy. First, the ECB's definition of price stability has been instrumental in enhancing the transparency of the policy framework and thereby the accountability of the ECB. The anchoring of long-term inflation expectations Second, with its quantitative definition the ECB has made a very significant contribution to the firm anchoring of inflation expectations. The definition of price stability permits all economic agents and the public at large to build expectations of future inflation outcomes. By providing a benchmark for inflation expectations, the quantitative definition of price stability has considerably facilitated the conduct of monetary policy by the ECB. Indeed, if the public can trust the ECB, we can assume that the setting of wages and prices will be compatible with the ECB's definition. This significantly reduces the likelihood of temporary bouts of inflation\", \" for wage developments in line with productivity thereby contributing to preserve the competitiveness of the euro area economy.

In particular, our interest rate decisions will be based on our assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. We are not pre-committing to a particular rate path. In any case, we stand ready to adjust all of our instruments within our mandate to ensure that inflation stabilises sustainably at our medium-term target and to preserve the smooth functioning of monetary policy transmission. We are now ready to take your questions. * * * I have two questions. The first is on a general flavour of the arguments which have been exchanged in order to reach the decision today. What were the key arguments in favour of that 25 basis points rate cut? Second question, you dropped the reference to keep interest rates restrictive or sufficiently restrictive for the foreseeable future. Does that also mean that you consider perhaps a larger rate cut at your next policy meeting, or is that something you have been discussing, at least? We had a Governing Council meeting that was the last of 2024 and which really led us to acknowledge, not yet the victory against inflation, not yet “mission accomplished”, but certainly it led us to acknowledge that inflation was really on track, in terms of reaching our 2% target in the medium-term. And that gave us a level of confidence to actually decide to cut and to decide the appropriate cut, which is, in our view, 25 basis points. That proposal was agreed by all members of the Governing Council. There were some discussions, with some proposals to consider possibly 50 basis points. But the overall agreement to which everybody rallied was that 25 basis points was actually the right decision. And I think it was predicated on three key elements. The', ' criterion would draw on all available economic and financial data to update expectations and risk assessments of the future inflation path; the second criterion would assess whether inflation outturns (suitably filtered to capture the persistent – or underlying – component of inflation) were on track to ensure a timely return of inflation to the target; the third criterion would be essential in calibrating rate decisions, since the required scale of rate hiking would depend on the observed impact of monetary tightening on financing conditions, the real economy and pricing decisions. [ 30 ] At the May meeting, a 25 basis point hike was agreed. The shift towards a smaller increment reflected the narrowing of the gap to the plausible range of peak rates, the ongoing improvement in the energy situation, the progress indicated by the cumulative decline in inflation in the opening months of 2023 (which was faster than expected in the December 2022 projections) and the gathering evidence of the substantial impact of monetary tightening on credit dynamics. [ 31 ] However, the ongoing pass-through of earlier energy price hikes into economy-wide prices, the pick-up in wage inflation (as workers gradually obtained pay increases to compensate for the loss in living standards due to the 2021-2022 inflation surge) and the assessment that inflation risks were still to the upside warranted the further hike. Moreover, the May statement also suggested that the stance was not yet sufficiently restrictive, stating that future policy rate decisions “will ensure that the policy rates will be brought to levels sufficiently restrictive to achieve a timely return of inflation to our two per cent medium-term target and will be kept at those levels for as long as necessary.” The inclusion of the duration of restrictiveness as well as the level of restrictiveness as determining the monetary policy stance was a natural evolution in the communication of the rate strategy. [ 32 ] In particular,', ' reduced concerns about inflation pressures. Tensions in global markets over the summer led to a temporary tightening of financial conditions in the riskier market segments. Overall, financing costs remain restrictive as our past policy rate increases continue to work their way through the transmission chain. The average interest rates on new loans to firms and on new mortgages stayed high in July, at 5.1 and 3.8 per cent respectively. Credit growth remains sluggish amid weak demand. Bank lending to firms grew at an annual rate of 0.6 per cent in July, down slightly from June, and growth in loans to households edged up to 0.5 per cent. Broad money – as measured by M3 – grew by 2.3 per cent in July, the same rate as in June. Conclusion The Governing Council today decided to lower the deposit facility rate by 25 basis points. We are determined to ensure that inflation returns to our two per cent medium-term target in a timely manner. We will keep policy rates sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary to achieve this aim. We will continue to follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction. In particular, our interest rate decisions will be based on our assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. We are not pre-committing to a particular rate path. In any case, we stand ready to adjust all of our instruments within our mandate to ensure that inflation returns to our medium-term target and to preserve the smooth functioning of monetary policy transmission.

Dinamarca sabe que puede llamar dos veces a la puerta del espacio euro como ya hizo a la de la Unión Europea. La necesidad europea de contar con una moneda común no conducía, unívocamente, a la creación del euro, al menos sobre el papel.

         "[' done so far to strengthen the EU financial stability framework in order to achieve these objectives? Such a framework comprises arrangements for banking supervision, financial stability monitoring, crisis management and deposit insurance. In the area of banking supervision, two important policy initiatives have recently been taken to enhance home-host cooperation between supervisors and to strengthen cross-border arrangements for the supervision of large and complex banking groups. The first policy measure is the improved legal framework for supervisory cooperation regarding banking groups with foreign subsidiaries, introduced by the recently adopted Capital Requirements Directive (CRD). In particular, the CRD entrusts the consolidating supervisor with coordination responsibilities. It also strengthens and clarifies the requirements for information sharing and cooperation between all authorities responsible for the supervision of group entities. This improved framework should promote and facilitate effective supervisory cooperation, especially for large groups that are active in several countries. The second important policy measure is the extension of the Lamfalussy framework to include the banking sector and the related activities of the Committee of European Banking Supervisors (CEBS) to promote supervisory cooperation. The forthcoming CEBS guidelines for supervisory cooperation will provide concrete guidance for the effective and consistent implementation of the revised legal framework for cross-border banking groups. This will also increase the effectiveness of the arrangements for supervisory cooperation with regard to cross-border banks that have a significant number of foreign branches in host countries. I would also like to remind you briefly that important initiatives have been taken to enhance the other public policies safeguarding financial stability. For example, in the area of financial stability monitoring, the Economic and Financial Committee’s recently established Financial Stability Table has played an important role in forming a comprehensive assessment of risks to financial stability in the EU. This work has been strongly supported by the Eurosystem, notably via the ESCB Banking Supervision Committee�', ' financial stability in a context of increased financial integration. Allow me to touch upon both issues. Since March last year, the Lamfalussy framework for financial regulation and supervision has been formally extended to the banking sector. I see this extended Lamfalussy framework as a major step to achieve the objective of consistent supervisory action across the EU and, in this way, to further promote financial integration. In its young existence, the Committee of European Banking Supervisors (CEBS) has already delivered an impressive amount of work in this area. Rightfully, the Committee has focused extensively on defining common approaches in the supervisory tools and practices (mainly relating to the implementation of the Basel II Framework) as well as on the cooperation between home and host supervisors. Both aspects are clearly of great interest to banks with cross-border presence. Looking ahead, what I see as the main challenge is the consistent implementation of the agreed standards and guidelines by the national supervisors. In this respect, I consider the recent decision of CEBS to establish operational networks (or colleges of supervisors) for specific cross-border groups and to create a coordination mechanism among them to be two important steps in the right direction. But there is more. Work is underway which aims at the development of a common supervisory culture; the adoption of a non-binding mediation mechanism among supervisors; the possible use of the cross-border delegation of supervisory tasks and responsibilities; and a further streamlining of banks’ reporting requirements. The ECB very much supports both the work of the CEBS and the concrete measures I have just mentioned in order to achieve the necessary convergence in supervisory practices. The aim is to exploit the opportunities offered by the existing institutional framework to the maximum possible extent. Is this enough? I am aware that for some of you the present arrangements and initiatives', ' used to the maximum extent possible. This entails pursuing two operational goals. First, to achieve supervisory convergence by the Level 3 committees which should deliver supervisory action that is consistent on a cross-border basis. The experience thus far is encouraging. Second, to achieve a strengthening of the cooperation between home and host authorities for the supervision of financial groups operating across borders. This is essential for reconciling the interests of supervisory authorities and the financial sector. A lack of progress could fuel demands to revise the current institutional set-up, as the financial industry occasionally points out. The work of the Level 3 committees is expected to strongly promote supervisory convergence and cooperation. Further developments in financial integration, especially the increasing prominence of both complex cross-border institutions spanning several Member States and large foreign establishments in host countries, may pose challenges to the current arrangements. Furthermore, financial integration calls for increased supervisory cooperation across financial sectors. In this respect, I recall that the three Level 3 committees, i.e. the Committee of European Banking Supervisors (CEBS), the Committee of European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Supervisors (CEIOPS) and the Committee of European Securities Regulators (CESR), signed last Thursday a joint protocol that aims to foster cooperation and coordination in their tasks of common interest. [ 10 ] As I already mentioned, the Eurosystem is of the view that the potential of the existing framework should be fully exploited. Furthermore, the review of the Lamfalussy approach due by the end of 2007 should provide the opportunity to form a comprehensive judgement about the progress made. I have now discussed EU policies and have spoken about the Eurosystem’s view on shaping the regulatory and legislative framework. We see the provision of such advice as one contribution we can make to support the process of financial integration. It']"

TLTRO III operations will start in September 2019 and end in March 2021, each with a maturity of two years. We decided that the interest rate in each operation will be set at a level that is 10 basis points above the average rate applied in the Eurosystem’s main refinancing operations over the life of the respective TLTRO. For banks whose eligible net lending exceeds a benchmark, the rate applied in TLTRO III will be lower, and can be as low as the average interest rate on the deposit facility prevailing over the life of the operation plus 10 basis points. The schedule defining the borrowing costs under TLTRO III is marginally less generous than that applied under the outstanding TLTRO II, in line with our intent of not discouraging banks that can afford to fund themselves in the market on attractive terms from doing so at TLTRO II maturity. At the same time, the pricing schedule incorporates features that can greatly enhance our accommodative monetary policy stance, as banks with strong lending performance will retain the opportunity to borrow at negative interest rates. The pricing remains sufficiently generous – especially when compared with alternative sources of funding – for banks to keep credit flowing to firms and households on a scale that can continue to support the economy and inflation. All in all, this set of decisions will provide the monetary accommodation necessary for inflation to remain on a sustained path towards levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term, while also preserving favourable bank lending conditions and supporting a smooth transmission of our monetary policy. This being said, the Governing Council remains ready to act in case of adverse contingencies and to use its instruments – as appropriate – to ensure', ' the key ECB interest rates and now expect them to remain at their present levels at least through the first half of 2020, and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation consistent with our inflation aim. Second, the Governing Council reaffirmed its intention to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the asset purchase programme. This will continue for an extended period of time past the date when we start raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation. Third, we decided on the modalities of the new series of quarterly targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) that was announced after our March meeting. We decided that the interest rate will be set at a level that is 10 basis points above the average rate on our main refinancing operations, but for banks whose eligible net lending exceeds a benchmark, the rate applied can be as low as the average deposit facility rate plus 10 basis points. This new series of TLTROs will help preserve favourable bank lending conditions and the smooth transmission of monetary policy. Looking ahead, the Governing Council is determined to act in case of adverse contingencies and also stands ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation continues to move towards the Governing Council’s inflation aim in a sustained manner. Completing Economic and Monetary Union To reap the full benefits from our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute decisively to raising the longer-term growth potential of the euro area and reducing its vulnerabilities. Sound fiscal and economic policies at the national level are the first line of defence to make the euro area stronger. Economic reform needs to be substantially stepped up in euro area countries to', ' when we start raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation. Fourth, we decided to change the modalities of the new series of quarterly targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) to preserve favourable bank lending conditions, ensure the smooth transmission of monetary policy and further support the accommodative stance of monetary policy. The interest rate in each operation will now be set at the level of the average rate applied in the Eurosystem’s main refinancing operations over the life of the respective TLTRO. For banks whose eligible net lending exceeds a benchmark, the rate applied in TLTRO III operations will be lower, and can be as low as the average interest rate on the deposit facility prevailing over the life of the operation. The maturity of the operations will be extended from two to three years. Fifth, in order to support the bank-based transmission of monetary policy the Governing Council decided to introduce a two-tier system for reserve remuneration in which part of banks’ holdings of excess liquidity will be exempt from the negative deposit facility rate. Separate press releases with further details of the measures taken by the Governing Council will be published this afternoon at 15:30 CET. The Governing Council reiterated the need for a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy for a prolonged period of time and continues to stand ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moves towards its aim in a sustained manner, in line with its commitment to symmetry.

         "['SB recommendations to introduce minimum initial levels are also quite narrow: they exclude sovereign paper and transactions between regulated institutions and apply only to non-centrally cleared operations. Going forward, more may have to be done. In regulatory circles, the potential for setting margins and haircuts as a policy tool to address systemic risks in derivatives and SFT markets was already identified shortly after the global financial crisis. Indeed, the BIS Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS) concluded, already in 2009, that margining practices in OTC derivatives and haircut-setting in SFTs are a source of procyclicality in the financial system, and recommended enhancements to these practices in order to dampen the build-up of leverage in good times and soften the system-wide effects in bad times. [ 38 ] Furthermore, the CGFS encouraged macroprudential authorities to consider measures that involve countercyclical variations in margins and haircuts. In the ECB’s response to the European Commission’s consultation on the review of the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR), we suggested “that macroprudential intervention tools be included in Level 1 of EMIR” and noted “two policy instruments that potentially could reduce or limit leverage through derivatives and SFTs and the pro-cyclicality of margins and haircuts: (a) permanent minimum requirements, and (b) time-varying minimum requirements or buffers”. [ 39 ] Setting minimum margins and haircut floors would limit the build-up of leverage and reduce the procyclicality of current margin and haircut setting practices. [ 40 ] On the other hand, I welcome the release of policy recommendations by the FSB to address structural vulnerabilities arising from asset management activities. They cover liquidity mismatch between fund investments and redemption terms', ' Therefore, I want to clearly state that the financial regulatory reform has to be completed and extended through further efforts to contain risks in the shadow banking sector and to strengthen macroprudential policies. Developing the macroprudential framework beyond banking Please allow me to elaborate on three important aspects of this task, namely tools to address the excessive use of leverage by investment funds, tools to address liquidity risks, and a framework for macroprudential margin and haircut requirements. As regards leverage in investment funds, we need to ensure that the use of leverage remains within acceptable limits. Highly leveraged funds can create and amplify systemic risk. When leverage is created through derivatives’ exposures or repo and securities lending transactions, margin calls or increasing haircuts on collateral can trigger a deleveraging by funds. [ 12 ] Notably, such a “margin spiral” [ 13 ] can even occur when funds are closed and investors cannot redeem their shares at short notice. To the extent that many funds are forced to sell assets in less liquid markets and at substantial discounts, this can reinforce price falls in financial markets and become a risk of systemic nature. [ 14 ] In order to curb the use of leverage by investment funds in the EU, it is useful to distinguish between funds that are subject to the regulatory framework of the Undertakings for Collective Investments in Transferable Securities (UCITS) Directive and those subject to the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD). In principle, all UCITS-funds have restrictions on the use of balance sheet and synthetic leverage. In practice, however, funds applying more complex investment strategies can calculate their use of leverage based on the Commitment Method or a Value at Risk (VaR) approach, resulting in a less stringent limit for synthetic leverage. Therefore, it is important that we examine', ' beyond traditional entities such as banks and insurers. This underlines the necessity of developing the macroprudential framework beyond banking. Developing the macroprudential framework beyond banking Let me elaborate on three important aspects of this task. First, we need to develop a framework to better control the leverage of alternative investment funds in the European Union. Given that the use of leverage by investment funds could create and amplify systemic risk, it is important that we ensure that leverage remains within acceptable limits. Second, we need to develop tools targeting liquidity in non-bank financial institutions . With regard to investment funds, “liquidity spirals” remain always a risk. Such spirals could be triggered if funds were to be confronted with high redemptions or increased margin requirements, as these could result in forced selling on markets with low liquidity. To address such risks, additional liquidity requirements, guided stress tests, minimum and time-varying load, and redemptions fees should be part of the macroprudential toolbox. Third, macroprudential authorities should be given the power to change margins and haircuts on derivatives and securities financing transactions (SFTs) at the transaction level in a time-varying manner . The current margining and haircut setting practices by market participants stimulate the build-up of leverage in good times, and amplify de-leveraging in bad times. While a number of policy measures aimed at limiting the pro-cyclical effects of margin and haircut setting have been adopted or are underway, none of these steps envisage time-varying implementation of margin requirements and haircut floors by macroprudential authorities.

         "[' dramatic – stress event was the uncertainty caused by the default of a clearing member at KRX, the South Korean CCP, which caused it to tap its mutualised default fund, and revealed that clearing members were not always aware of their potential liabilities towards the CCP. When such events occur, they have the potential to shut down the markets they serve. With the emergence of super-systemic CCPs serving global derivatives markets, a CCP failure could be a catastrophic event of global proportions. In September 2014, the gross notional outstanding amount of centrally cleared positions was estimated at USD 169 trillion for OTC interest rate derivatives, and at USD 14 trillion for credit derivatives [ 7 ] . The sheer magnitude of these figures (around ten times the GDP of the United States or European Union) gives us an idea of the severity of the potential consequences from a stress event at a major global CCP. Authorities see the distinct benefits of central clearing and wish to set proper market incentives for participants to move away from bilateral trading and into the centrally cleared world. Mandatory central clearing allows risks to be pooled, monitored and properly managed. However, pushing more complex products towards mandatory central clearing makes risk management more challenging, and therefore may increase the risks to which CCPs and clearing members are exposed. Authorities may need to assess whether overly complex products should really be submitted to central clearing, so as to ensure CCPs can continue pooling risks in a safe and efficient way. In recent months, concerns have been expressed regarding the adequacy and consistency of the level of risk management across the CCP landscape. At this stage, it is too early to say whether current regulations are insufficient. New requirements may well prove necessary but the impact and coverage of the existing regulatory framework should first be comprehensively assessed. Authorities have started exploring and analysing potential issues with the granularity and', ' number of challenges in applying these risk management standards Building on the foundations established by the CPMI-IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures , EMIR sets out strict binding rules for managing the potential risks stemming from interoperability arrangements. These rules relate to the provision of margins between interoperating CCPs, the necessary harmonisation of CCP risk management frameworks and the use of inter-CCP resources in default situations. Crucially, the establishment of interoperability arrangements is subject to the approval of colleges that are set up under EMIR in order to supervise CCPs. Cooperative supervision arrangements are particularly necessary with regard to interoperability arrangements, which require a high level of scrutiny from a number of relevant authorities, including the supervisors of the two interoperating CCPs and the central banks of issue of the most relevant currencies cleared through the link. Nonetheless, we should not underestimate the challenges CCPs face in establishing and managing safe interoperability arrangements. The task of harmonising risk models and ensuring that interoperating CCPs cannot contaminate each other in the event of a clearing member default is not straightforward. While CCP interoperability is and should remain a market-led process, the close involvement of all relevant authorities is vital in ensuring that CCPs have appropriately compared their risk management frameworks and taken the necessary steps to make these models compatible with each other. Authorities also have a key role in making sure interoperating CCPs have comprehensively assessed the risks they pose to each other. As an example, CCPs which enter into an interoperability arrangement must collect and exchange margins to cover their reciprocal exposures. Under EU rules, these resources are not part of the CCPs’ regular default waterfalls, and are exclusively provided for the purpose of covering losses from one interoperating CCP going into default. In other words, they cannot be', 'The order of the topics at today’s conference on “resolution in Europe” was well planned. [ 1 ] The fact that we are discussing central counterparty (CCP) resolution after discussing bank resolution echoes the fact that CCP resolution is, by and large, an event that occurs only when all other safeguards, including bank resolution, have failed. There are a number of reasons for this. One is that the ways in which CCPs are set up makes them particularly resilient. CCPs are not banks, they are (financial market) infrastructures. They manage the risk of a matched book and rely on the strength of their membership to provide margin and to share losses if this proves insufficient. Bail-in is integral to CCPs’ operational set-up, as clearing members are required to share losses. In this way, their resilience is further strengthened by banking supervision and recovery and resolution arrangements which help ensure that clearing members meet their obligations. Another reason for CCPs’ resilience is the implementation of international standards. [ 2 ] The Principles for Financial Markets Infrastructures of the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) have recently benefitted from more granular guidance providing clarity to CCPs and their regulators. [ 3 ] This also includes risks other than financial ones. The adoption of the CPMI-IOSCO guidance on cyber resilience for financial market infrastructures, for example, is an important step towards operational resilience. [ 4 ] Yet, while CCP resolution remains a very unlikely event, the disorderly failure of a major CCP would be disastrous. Many CCPs are globally systemic, responsible for clearing global markets and with participants from across the world. This is why the']"

This is critical to ensure the credibility of the new framework and address spillovers in a timely manner. Second , enforcement tools need to be more effective. In addition to financial sanctions, political and reputational measures would help foster early compliance, as would the application of earlier and more gradual financial sanctions within the macroeconomic surveillance framework. Discretion to reduce or suspend financial sanctions is undesirable as it strongly reduces effectiveness and sets the wrong incentives. Third , more ambitious policy requirements would better match the current reality of the euro area. It makes sense for macroeconomic surveillance to have a clear focus on the euro area countries with large current account deficits, significant losses of competitiveness and high levels of public and private debt. As regards fiscal surveillance, ambitious benchmarks are needed when establishing an excessive deficit and in setting the adjustment path towards a country’s medium-term budgetary objective. Finally , the gap between the EU and national level must be closed. New procedures will not be sufficient if they are not solidly anchored at national level. Binding commitments by Member States to swiftly implement strong national budgetary frameworks are essential. In my view, the proposals agreed by the Council do not represent the significant leap towards closer economic union that is required. The European Parliament has been more ambitious in its approach, particularly as regards greater automaticity and the broader and more timely use of sanctions. I hope that the ongoing negotiations over the legislative package will permit the texts to be significantly improved along these lines. I believe that the citizens of Europe count on the European Parliament to take a broader perspective and drive these changes forward. There are also some important areas in which care should be taken not to weaken the texts. In particular, softening the Stability and', 'automaticity in the application of sanctions, based on clearly defined criteria and with less discretion over outcomes. And we need ambitious targets for the reduction of public debt towards the 60% of GDP ceiling. The second key area is broader surveillance of macroeconomic policies in the euro area.

It should be determined by transparent and effective trigger mechanisms and specify clearly the sanctions in case of breach. And we need full transparency. The assessments of macroeconomic imbalances and recommendations for corrective action should be given broad publicity at all stages of the surveillance process. The effectiveness of these enhancements to the governance framework will in part be determined by the quality and independence of the economic analysis that underpins them. Without reliable statistical data we cannot be certain that the governance framework will provide the quantum leap forward that is necessary. It is therefore extremely important that the Commission services charged with conducting macroeconomic and fiscal surveillance for the euro area be sufficiently independent, ideally supported by a body of “wise persons” providing external assessments. Conclusion Let me conclude. The past 12 years have been very challenging, demanding and eventful years. The ECB has lived up to its responsibility and delivered what we promised to deliver: a stable currency, as credible and confidence-inspiring as the best previous currencies. The euro has also been a force of stability in what is now a more than three year period of economic and financial instability. As is the case in all major advanced economies which all, without exception, have to put under sharp review their previous surveillance framework and economic models, changes are needed in the euro area framework. Not the kind of changes towards more unilateral action, with dangers of', ' debt with three main elements: shorter deadlines under excessive deficit procedures; quasi-automaticity in the application of sanctions, based on clearly defined criteria and with less discretion over outcomes; and ambitious targets for the reduction of public debt towards the 60% ceiling.

I would like to express my solidarity, my compassion, and my sincere condolences to the families and friends of the victims. Our societies are founded on a social contract. A common understanding of fundamental values and principles, such as democracy, the rule of law and human rights, forms the basis for peaceful coexistence. Such a social contract need not be constrained to the national level. It can also – and does – exist at the supra-national level. It is on this basis that, in Europe, Member States share sovereignty, most notably as some of us share a “currency beyond the state”. In my remarks today, I will: first, lay out the legal scope for sharing sovereignty; and second, elaborate on what this means for further European integration in different policy areas. The Lisbon Treaty sets out several restrictions regarding the transfer of sovereignty from the national to the European level: Sovereignty in the Union rests with the Member States. The Union owes its existence to the Member States, as they confer competences on the Union in order to attain common objectives (Article 1 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)). National security remains the sole responsibility of the constituent states (Article 4 Paragraph 2, TFEU). The Union is governed by the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality (Article 5 TFEU). As you can see, the letter and spirit of the Lisbon Treaty do not suggest that the EU should be transformed into a sovereign state called Europe. Nevertheless, some national constitutional courts saw the need to further emphasise that Member States remain viable and independent political entities, coining the term “constitutional identity”.', 'I have many reasons to be grateful and honoured by your decision to award me the Premio De Gasperi today. His character and his experience provide us with an inspiring message, loud and confident: “In Europe we go forward together in freedom”. This message is rooted in the 20th century history of our continent. The raison d’être of any government is to provide security for its citizens, both physically and economically. And in democratic societies, that means providing safety and security by preserving individual liberties and individual rights, by promoting social fairness and equal opportunities. The statesmen who, after World War Two, looked back over the preceding half-century could reach only one conclusion: that the governments which emerged from nationalist and populist movements, and which were carried into power by a mixture of charisma and lies, completely failed to offer their citizens security, fairness and freedom. They had betrayed the very reason for their existence. In outlining the future shape of international relations, De Gasperi and his contemporaries concluded that only cooperation between European governments within a common organisation could ensure the joint security of their citizens. They saw that implanting democracy in the nations of Europe would not be enough. Europe also needed democracy among nations. They understood that building barriers between countries would make them more vulnerable and less secure, not least due to their geographical proximity; and that withdrawing behind one’s borders would make governments less effective. De Gasperi’s vision of how this joint process should be shaped was articulated in various speeches he gave in those years. Common challenges should be addressed via supranational instead of intergovernmental strategies. Speaking to the assembly of the European Coal and Steel Community in 1954, De Gasperi noted that “…from 1919 to 1939, some seventy international treaties were concluded –', ' human rights and democracy. The new Europe is founded on the values of tolerance, human dignity and peace. As the Berlin Declaration in 2007, on the occasion of the 50 th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome says: “In the European Union, we are turning our common ideals into reality: for us, the individual is paramount. His dignity is inviolable. His rights are inalienable.” The European institutions are grounded on those values: “striving for peace and freedom, for democracy and the rule of law, for mutual respect and shared responsibility, for prosperity and security, for tolerance and participation, for justice and solidarity”. We must not lose sight of these values, especially now when the aftermath of the Great Recession of 2008-09 is producing signs of emerging nationalism, offensive racism and dangerous xenophobia. Populism and extreme ideologies are again using democracy to erode its core values. We need a sense of European unity to strengthen our Institutions. It has been by overcoming narrow nationalisms that Europe has been built. Nations are a construct of man, not a natural reality. They reflect that our consciousness and our knowledge are socially constituted. In his famous Vienna address in 1935 on the existential crisis of Europe, Edmund Husserl concluded: “The existential crisis of Europe has only two outcomes: either Europe will disappear in becoming ever more distant from its own rational signification, that is its vital sense, and will sink in the hatred of the spirit and in barbarity; or Europe will be reborn from the philosophical spirit as a result of a heroism of reason that will overcome naturalism”.

Over time however, the range of topics on the agenda has widened, and now includes issues such as development, energy, climate change. The G20 has also played a decisive role in leading by example to promote the wider compliance with standards and codes in various areas and was instrumental in the process leading to the “Principles for Stable Capital Flows and Fair Debt Restructuring in Emerging Markets”. At present, the G20 is also actively involved in the efforts to reform the IMF and the World Bank, especially in the current discussions on reforming the IMF’s quota and voice system. In my view, it is the composition and size of the membership that strike a good balance between giving this informal forum a rather high degree of legitimacy while at the same time also allowing for frank dialogue between the members. Frank dialogue is also one of the important aspects of the continued relevance of the G7. The G7/G8 process is often criticised for no longer reflecting the political and economic realities of the 21st century. But the meetings of G7 finance ministers and central bank governors that I have attended over the past 18 years have proven an invaluable forum for policy cooperation on macroeconomic policies and when appropriate signals given to foreign exchange markets. G7 countries have also recognised the need to involve emerging markets in their discussions, and it is now standard practice for finance ministers and governors from emerging economies – and at times also from developing countries – to be invited to join the discussions of their G7 colleagues. A very recent example of a new form of informal cooperation is the Heiligendamm process that started at the G8 summit this summer. Here again the G8 acknowledged that there can be no solution to global challenges without active participation of', ' involved. Let me briefly take some examples. One of the most important of these fora is the Group of Seven or G7. Finance ministers and central bank governors of the seven most industrialised nations of the world, including of course Japan, meet several times a year to discuss issues of mutual interest. My experience is that the G7 meetings have proven an invaluable forum for cooperation on macroeconomic policies and for giving, when appropriate, signals to market participants. An important step was made a few months ago when the G8 committed in Heiligendamm to embark on a high-level dialogue with important emerging economies, among which are Asia’s two population giants, China and India. This dialogue will focus on issues of global dimension which will be at the top of the agenda in the years ahead. These include, for instance: cross-border investment; research, innovation and intellectual property rights; climate change; energy efficiency; and development, particularly in Africa. A related example is the creation of the Group of Twenty, or G20. The G20 is an international policy forum for dialogue and consensus-building among systemically important countries, both industrialised and emerging. It was created a decade ago in the aftermath of the Asian crisis, together with the Financial Stability Forum. In the early years of its existence indeed, the G20 – one-third of which comprises countries from the Asia-Pacific region – put special emphasis on financial stability and crisis prevention, including aspects such as prudent debt management, domestic financial deepening and exchange rate regimes. Its agenda has widened since then. It now includes some of the most important global policy challenges ahead of us, such as development, energy and climate change. Last, significant reform efforts are under way at the International Monetary Fund to adapt the institution to a new environment and a', ' been constructively involved in helping shape mechanisms of crisis prevention and resolution. The G7 has also responded swiftly to the changing global economic environment by reaching out to the growing number of systemically important countries. It has invited representatives from major emerging market countries, including Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, to parts of its meetings so as to enable an appropriate exchange of views on issues of relevance to global macroeconomic and financial stability. Such outreach activities have also been launched by the BIS as regards meetings at Governors’ as well as experts’ level. Finally, the internal governance structure of the IMF is currently under review. The goal of the reform efforts is in particular to ensure a fair and adequate voice for all members of the IMF by aligning the distribution of quotas with countries’ relative positions in the world economy. Multilateral and regional dimension of monitoring and surveillance A second change pertains to the increased attention paid to the growing integration of national economies into the global economy and the related international linkages. Here I will highlight some improvements relating to the surveillance activities of the IMF. One important change concerns multilateral surveillance where the goal is to add a more global perspective to IMF surveillance and to place greater focus on international linkages and spillovers. This is clearly desirable given the ever closer integration of national economies. Cross-checking between multilateral and bilateral surveillance helps promote policies that are consistent not only with other domestic policies, but also with global adjustment within the international monetary system. To foster cooperation on issues of systemic relevance, the International Community has launched a new supplementary consultation procedure in a multilateral format. I trust that this multilateral consultation following the Spring 2006 IMFC meeting has been useful. And I have noted with satisfaction that the policy plans, set out by the participants, represent further progress in the implementation']"

Inflation continues to decline but is still expected to remain too high for too long. We are determined to ensure that inflation returns to our two per cent medium-term target in a timely manner. The Governing Council therefore today decided to raise the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. The rate increase today reflects our assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation, and the strength of monetary policy transmission. The developments since our last meeting support our expectation that inflation will drop further over the remainder of the year but will stay above target for an extended period. While some measures show signs of easing, underlying inflation remains high overall. Our past rate increases continue to be transmitted forcefully: financing conditions have tightened again and are increasingly dampening demand, which is an important factor in bringing inflation back to target. Our future decisions will ensure that the key ECB interest rates will be set at sufficiently restrictive levels for as long as necessary to achieve a timely return of inflation to our two per cent medium-term target. We will continue to follow a data-dependent approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction. In particular, our interest rate decisions will continue to be based on our assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation, and the strength of monetary policy transmission. We also decided to set the remuneration of minimum reserves at zero per cent.

I would like to thank Governor Vasle for his kind hospitality and express our special gratitude to his staff for the excellent organisation of today’s meeting of the Governing Council. The Governing Council today decided to lower the three key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points. In particular, the decision to lower the deposit facility rate – the rate through which we steer the monetary policy stance – is based on our updated assessment of the inflation outlook, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. The incoming information on inflation shows that the disinflationary process is well on track. The inflation outlook is also affected by recent downside surprises in indicators of economic activity. Meanwhile, financing conditions remain restrictive. Inflation is expected to rise in the coming months, before declining to target in the course of next year. Domestic inflation remains high, as wages are still rising at an elevated pace. At the same time, labour cost pressures are set to continue easing gradually, with profits partially buffering their impact on inflation. We are determined to ensure that inflation returns to our two per cent medium-term target in a timely manner. We will keep policy rates sufficiently restrictive for as long as necessary to achieve this aim. We will continue to follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction. In particular, our interest rate decisions will be based on our assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. We are not pre-committing to a particular rate path. The decisions taken today are set out in a press release available on our website.', 'Jump to the transcript of the questions and answers Good afternoon, the Vice-President and I welcome you to our press conference. The Governing Council today decided to keep the three key ECB interest rates unchanged. The incoming information has broadly confirmed our previous assessment of the medium-term inflation outlook. Aside from an energy-related upward base effect on headline inflation, the declining trend in underlying inflation has continued, and our past interest rate increases keep being transmitted forcefully into financing conditions. Tight financing conditions are dampening demand, and this is helping to push down inflation. We are determined to ensure that inflation returns to our two per cent medium-term target in a timely manner. Based on our current assessment, we consider that the key ECB interest rates are at levels that, maintained for a sufficiently long duration, will make a substantial contribution to this goal. Our future decisions will ensure that our policy rates will be set at sufficiently restrictive levels for as long as necessary. We will continue to follow a data-dependent approach to determining the appropriate level and duration of restriction. In particular, our interest rate decisions will be based on our assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial data, the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary policy transmission. The decisions taken today are set out in a press release available on our website. I will now outline in more detail how we see the economy and inflation developing and will then explain our assessment of financial and monetary conditions. Economic activity The euro area economy is likely to have stagnated in the final quarter of 2023. The incoming data continue to signal weakness in the near term. However, some forward-looking survey indicators point to a pick-up in growth further ahead. The labour market has remained robust. The unemployment rate, at 6.4 per cent in November, has']"

         "[' payment stakeholders in Europe. Since the payments market is a network industry, cooperation and coordination among market players are of utmost importance. We at the ECB are well aware of the importance of European-wide cooperation. In 2013, we established the Euro Retail Payments Board (ERPB) with the objective of further deepening such cooperation. This high-level strategic body brings together the supply and demand sides of the European retail payments market. A great deal has been achieved under the umbrella of the ERPB thanks to the efforts of all involved and I am pleased to see that further work on developing innovative and competitive payment services is under way. The ERPB’s most important work at the moment relates to instant payments. I will later explain why I think that the ERPB’s work on instant payments is so important for the future of an integrated European payments market. The ERPB can be considered the cradle of euro instant payments. In response to its call for the development of a pan-European instant payment scheme, the market delivered: the European Payments Council (EPC) developed the Instant Credit Transfer (SCT Inst) scheme in November 2017. For the first time in Europe, a significant payment scheme was established with full stakeholder involvement, both on the supply and demand sides, and in a remarkably short amount of time. Some 51% of European payment service providers that offer credit transfer services are reachable for instant payments by now. The Eurosystem also responded to the increasing need for instant payments by developing TARGET instant payment settlement (TIPS), which is based on the SCT Inst scheme. Launched in November 2018, this pan-European market infrastructure allows payment service users to send and receive payments instantly and around the clock within Europe. Offering instant payment services at the European level ensures that any bank account holder in', ' up at national level. Where such bodies are not in place, I expect them to emerge in the near future. In my view, what also needs to be developed further is closer coordination between those national payments committees and the ERPB, under the strategic guidance of the European Commission and the ECB. There is a lot to be gained from this. First, there is a high level of expertise in national payments committees and comparable bodies at national level that could be better utilised in the ERPB processes. Second, national payments committees could adopt the model of broad stakeholder involvement from both the supply and demand sides. And last but not least, closer cooperation between national payments committees and the ERPB could lead to more efficient standardisation and harmonisation measures – in particular when it comes to innovative services and products – and avoid the potential duplication of work. ERPB facilitating pan-European retail payment innovation At present, the most-discussed areas of retail payment innovation in Europe are instant payments, payment initiation services and P2P mobile payments. The ERPB is active in all three areas. Instant payments Under the impetus of the ERPB, in 2016 the European Payments Council delivered a pan-European instant payment scheme based on the SEPA Credit Transfer Scheme, called SCT inst . Payment service providers are encouraged to make instant payment solutions in euro available to end users at a pan-European level from November 2017. While the work of the ERPB is focused on the scheme layer of instant payments, the Governing Council of the ECB recently decided to develop a service for the settlement of instant payments – the TARGET instant payments settlement (TIPS) service. TIPS will ensure that the demand for instant payments is met at European level and further facilitate the integration of the euro area, and is meant to complement the services of automated clearing', ' is why today I call on the industry to take the next step and develop end-user solutions that will allow consumers and businesses to enjoy the benefits of instant electronic payments in any payment situation, in addition to cash, which is still popular. Instant payments – a tool for innovation in payments Until now, the focus has mainly been on the three basic layers of the instant payments pyramid: the scheme, clearing and settlement layers. Great progress has been made in all three of these: At the request of the Euro Retail Payments Board (ERPB), the European Payments Council launched the SEPA Instant Credit Transfer (SCT Inst) scheme in November 2017, which over 1,000 payment service providers have already joined, with many more set to follow. Several automated clearing houses in Europe have started clearing SCT Inst transactions, supported by an enhanced settlement module provided by the Eurosystem. The TARGET instant payment settlement (TIPS) service is scheduled to go live in November 2018, ensuring the pan-European reach of instant payments – which has been one of the main objectives of the ERPB in that context. These layers form the basis on which new, user-friendly services could be built. However, for instant payments to reach their full potential, a fourth layer is needed: the end-user solution layer. Without efficient, user-friendly end-user solutions, instant payments only make ordinary credit transfers faster – but instant payments can be much more than that: they can be a basis for innovation. We have recognised the importance of end-user solutions from the beginning. That is why person-to-person (P2P) mobile payments have been a priority for the Eurosystem and the ERPB. A service that will allow people all around Europe to make mobile payments to others, using their mobile phone number as an identifier']"

In the view of many commentators, the SRM became the expected instrument to achieve the separation of banks and sovereigns. This is a somewhat misleading view as only in combination with the later approval of the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) could the SRM be effective in solving the bank-sovereign loop. The BRRD gave powers to the SRM to resolve banks using wide bail-in of shareholders and main bank’s liabilities without having to utilise the resolution fund or public money. The BRRD implements a true paradigm change, ending the culture of bail-out and ushering in a culture of bail-in. As of 2016, in all resolution cases, the BRRD will impose to the Resolution Authorities, a bail-in of shareholders and creditors equal to at least 8% of total liabilities including own funds of a given bank. It should be noted that the amount of 8% is very substantial when compared to the losses that banks faced in the recent crisis. To give you an idea: between 2008 and 2010 only one bank had losses exceeding the 8% threshold, and the average for all other banks was slightly less than 3%. If we look further back to the Nordic financial crisis in the 90s, none of the banks affected faced losses close to 8% of its total liabilities including own funds. According to the new rules, only insured deposits are totally excluded from the bail-in tool. Only after the 8% amount is bailed-in from shareholders and creditors can the resolution fund, to which the banking sector contributes, take part in the process and for a maximum amount of 5% of total liabilities (including own funds) of the bank under', ' levies from the private sector. This would ensure that the SRA has access to the necessary financing to take resolution action and achieve least-cost solutions, as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) does in the US. Third, in order to ensure the credibility of the Fund, it should have access to a temporary and fiscally neutral fiscal backstop at euro area level, to be used only as a last resort. Indeed, in order for the SRM to be effective, it will require a common resolution framework, containing comprehensive powers and tools. A harmonised toolbox of resolution powers is foreseen in the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive, so it is crucial that this Directive is adopted as an immediate priority and passed into law before the SSM is operational. A key resolution tool included in the Directive, one that all authorities should have, is the possibility of bailing in by creditors. Bailing-in is conducive to achieving a specific policy goal, namely that the burden of bank failures should be borne first and foremost by the private sector, rather than the taxpayer. In accordance with the Financial Stability Board’s Key Attributes of Efficient Resolution Regimes for Financial Institutions, which have been incorporated in the BRRD, resolution authorities should be able to write down or convert into equity liabilities in a manner that respects the hierarchy of claims in a liquidation. Thus, when a bail-in by creditors takes place, legal certainty and predictability are essential. Despite the limited spillovers, the idiosyncratic aspects of the bail-in by uninsured depositors in Cyprus may remain a cause for concern among investors. Creditors need to have a clear picture of what could happen in the event of a bank failure. This is key to avoiding excessive market volatility, bank runs, underprovision of capital', '. By mutualising the cost of bank resolution, this approach will loosen the link between domestic banks and their sovereigns and further level the playing field. A shortcoming of the SRM, however, is the absence of a clear common financing arrangement that would provide additional temporary resources when needed. In practice, however, the SSM and SRM may not be sufficient to completely sever the ties between sovereigns and their domestic banks. The effect of SSM and harmonised supervision on trust among banks may be more limited than expected, while, more importantly, the SRM may face legal limitations to autonomously managing the orderly resolutions of significant banks using its own funds. These limitations come from the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD), which is applicable to all 28 EU member countries. Let me explain. The BRRD is in my view one of the most crucial regulatory change in Europe of late. It represents a true paradigm change, ending the culture of bail-out and ushering in a culture of bail-in. As of 2016, in all resolution cases, the BRRD will require a bail-in of shareholders and creditors equal to at least 8% of total liabilities of a given bank, including own funds. Only after the 8% threshold can money from the resolution fund be used and for a maximum amount of 5% of total liabilities (including own funds) of the bank under resolution. Public money, either from national governments or from direct European recapitalisation of banks, can only be used at the very end of the process which, in practice, should happen exceedingly rarely. Bail-in of shareholders and creditors plus the use of the Resolution Fund should in most conceivable cases, be enough to ultimately cover for the losses incurred by the bank.

         "[', the failure to fulfil fiscal Maastricht criteria could derail the entry to EMU. Second, reasonably sound public finances are crucial for an effective and exhaustive use of structural EU funds. At this point let me make a few remarks on the Stability and Growth Pact. Since the very beginning of the discussion on the reform of the Pact, the ECB has strongly recommended preservation of the integrity of the corrective arm of the Pact, with the nominal anchor of 3% and the excessive deficit procedure, and to improve and make more effective the implementation of the preventive arm of the Pact. It has always been our position. After the decision of the Council of Ministers on 21 March we said that “it is imperative that Member States, the European Commission, and the Council of the European Union implement the revised framework in a rigorous manner, conducive to prudent fiscal policies”. And I said last Thursday, on behalf of the Governing Council, that it is now “essential that the European Commission and the ECOFIN Council strictly enforce the new agreement on the implementation of the Pact so as to restore the framework’s credibility”. Now let me turn to the long-term role of fiscal policy. A fiscal policy that is set according to rules adds to macroeconomic stability by providing economic agents with expectations of a predictable economic environment. This reduces uncertainty and promotes longer-term decision-making, notably investment decisions, and economic growth. Furthermore, it is important to keep in mind that fiscal policy can also promote growth and employment via appropriate adjustments of the level and composition of government taxes and expenditures. Reducing inefficient public spending can for example help to finance tax cuts. Furthermore, public expenditures can be redirected towards productivity-enhancing physical and human capital accumulation rather than, for instance, the provision of subsidies for declining industries. This', ', fully in line with the orientations provided by the Stability and Growth Pact. Moreover fiscal policy can and should also help mitigate undesirable trend growth differentials through “high quality” expenditure and tax policies. In particular, high and inefficient public expenditure can put a brake on economic activity by imposing a high tax burden on the economy and channelling resources into unproductive uses. Let me take the opportunity to stress that the Governing Council of the ECB welcomes the recent commitment by the euro area finance ministers at the Eurogroup meeting here in Berlin on 20April. All euro area finance ministers then committed to making full use of the current economic growth and better than expected tax revenues to pursue sound fiscal policies and to avoid procyclical policies in line with the provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact. In the view of the Governing Council, this requires a rigorous implementation of 2007 budgets, the avoidance of expenditure overruns and the allocation of unexpected extra revenues to deficit and debt reduction. For 2008, countries with remaining fiscal imbalances are expected to pursue more ambitious than currently planned budgetary targets. This would allow euro area countries not only to meet their commitments but also to prepare themselves for less favourable economic conditions and the rising fiscal burden in the longer run associated with population ageing. In this context, the gradual increase of the pension age in Germany is an important step in the right direction. It will help to reduce the large ageing-related fiscal burden on the active and younger generations. Let me finally mention the important issue of competitiveness . One of the most important market-based adjustment mechanisms in a monetary union works via changes in competitiveness. [ 17 ] Simply put, competitiveness is the ability of an economy to compete in international markets. This ability to compete is usually assessed on the basis of various measures of cost and price competitiveness [ 18 ]', '-term imbalances in patterns of demand. It is sometimes argued that the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact will prevent national governments from using fiscal policy to address these imbalances. However, if implemented correctly and without undue delay, the contrary is true, as compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact provisions will allow sufficient room for manoeuvre. The centre-piece of the budgetary provisions to be respected by Member States is the medium-term objective of a budgetary position close to balance or in surplus. Sound government finances are important to strengthen the conditions for price stability and for the strong and sustainable growth necessary to support employment growth. Moreover, if governments achieve balanced budgets in normal periods of the cycle, they create a safety margin, sufficient to allow the operation of automatic stabilisers in the event of a slowdown, or in the face of unexpected shocks, without risking excessive deficits. The problem at the moment is that in the euro area as a whole we are still far from reaching the target of balanced budgets in normal cyclical conditions. Substantial structural imbalances continue to restrict the flexibility of public sector budgets. In a number of countries, deficit-to-GDP ratios remain close to the 3% value set in the Treaty as a reference for excessive deficits, rather than the medium-term balanced or surplus position envisaged in the Stability and Growth Pact. Recent fiscal consolidation has been rather disappointing. A significant increase in overall deficits, for instance as a response to a decline in real GDP growth rates, could reverse the progress we have seen in recent years in reducing deficit-to-GDP ratios across the euro area. Moreover, in the case of a prolonged growth slowdown, it is quite possible that deficits will quickly reach excessive levels. So it is clear that it is of the utmost importance that governments make structural improvements to']"

Will the interventions that will be decided now be enough to ensure the much talked-about “sustainability”? The ECB supports the need for debt measures in line with the Eurogroup agreement of 25 May 2016. The nature of the measures is for the euro area Member States to decide. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) argues that Greek debt is not sustainable and that the primary surpluses foreseen in the July agreement will be difficult to achieve. Greece’s EU creditors take a different view. Doesn’t this disagreement between the institutions send mixed signals to the international markets and to investors? All the institutions have voiced concerns about the sustainability of Greek debt. There are different views on the primary surplus which the measures included in the MoU can deliver, but diversity of views is in itself useful: risks should be highlighted and accounted for by specific debt measures. Let me say again that I consider IMF participation to be a factor of credibility for the programme. Do you agree with the view that the policy mix applied in Greece, with successive tax increases, spending cuts and high targets for primary surpluses, is “deadly” for economic growth? Bringing public finances back into surplus is a necessity for Greece given its high debt level, with or without debt measures. Of course, consolidation itself should be carried out in a growth-friendly way and tilted towards a reduction in expenditure rather than an increase in taxation. Fiscal policies are embedded in a wider reform strategy comprising labour and product market reforms, measures to fight tax evasion and the reduction of non-performing loans (NPLs) to allow banks to lend', 'Can the threat of Grexit be ruled out? I hope so. This was the first time that the question of keeping a country in the euro area had clearly been asked. This question was not put to the ECB, however, but to the government leaders, in a highly political manner. They answered it with the agreement of 13 July. The message is clear: everyone wants Greece to remain a member of the monetary union. They are prepared to continue to show unprecedented financial solidarity towards Athens, but not at any price. Greece must implement reforms that will ensure economic growth and stability. Must there be debt relief for Greek public debt? That is no longer a matter of debate. Moreover, the European leaders have shown willingness to discuss this topic. In truth, the question is not whether Greek debt should be restructured, but how to do it so it really benefits the country’s economy. Hence the importance of making this restructuring, whatever form it may take, conditional on the implementation of measures that will contribute to strengthening the economy and ensuring the sustainability of the Greek public finances. Will the third rescue package succeed where the first two failed? One of the keys to success lies in the capacity of the Greek government to make its citizens understand that the measures requested are not a form of punishment. These measures are crucial to both the development of the economy and the good functioning of the administration. The programme’s reforms do not aim to impose unbridled neo-liberalism on Athens. On the contrary, they aim to create a modern and fairer fiscal, social and legal framework, and to build an efficient state that is able to intervene in the economy for the common good, something that the Greek state has often failed to do in the past. The role of the ECB in the Greek crisis has been heavily criticised.', ', some questions regarding Greece. The Greek government has declared that the Troika and the Memorandum of Understanding no longer exist. How would you describe the state of play? On 24 February, the European Commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund considered the list of reforms presented by the Greek government as a valid starting point for a successful completion of the review under the current arrangement, and the Eurogroup agreed to extend it by four months. In this context, the authorities have committed to fully cooperate with the three institutions, in order to allow for a speedy and successful conclusion of the review. We are looking forward to working with the Greek authorities. Time is running short. The new government looks determined to boost reforms. Besides, this is the only way in which to restore trust with the European authorities. But the country has and will have specific financing needs over the next 18 months. Is a new programme for Greece a scenario that’s being considered? The Eurogroup has outlined a clear sequence. When the current review is concluded successfully, and if the Greek authorities so wish, a follow-up arrangement will be discussed with the Eurogroup. But it is first and foremost the responsibility of the Greek government to create growth and regain financial independence. This requires in my view a clear resolve to boost economic reforms, a prudent fiscal path and an unequivocal confirmation that Greece will honour its international commitments. Doubts about the country’s creditworthiness will then recede and foreign investors will return to Greece. The new government is negotiating with the European Commission, the ECB and the IMF in full awareness of the fundamental hypothesis that in the end no one would want a Grexit. If that is true, why didn’t Europe realise earlier that the Greek programme was not working effectively? The recession and unemployment in Greece cannot']"

These relate notably to the increasing capacity utilisation in the euro area economy, the possibility of further oil price rises and additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those announced and decided thus far. More fundamentally, stronger than currently expected wage developments could pose significant upward risks to price stability, not least in view of the favourable momentum in labour markets observed over the past few quarters. The Governing Council is monitoring wage negotiations in the euro area countries with particular attention. It is crucial that the social partners meet their responsibilities so as to continue to avoid wage developments that would eventually lead to inflationary pressures and harm the purchasing power of all euro area citizens. In this context, it is also important to point out that wage agreements should be sufficiently differentiated and take into account price competitiveness positions, the still high level of unemployment in many economies and productivity developments across sectors. The monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longer horizons. The underlying rate of monetary expansion remains strong, in a context of already ample liquidity. The ongoing strength of monetary expansion is reflected in the increasingly rapid growth of M3, which in March reached an annual rate of 10.9%, as well as in the ongoing high levels of credit growth. Monetary and credit expansion is due partly to the moderate level of interest rates and solid economic growth. Short-term monetary and credit developments can be affected, inter alia, by the shape of the yield curve and external factors, and be subject to some degree of volatility. Looking through such transitory aspects, there are, however, several indications that higher short-term interest rates are influencing monetary dynamics, although they have not, as yet, significantly dampened the overall strength of these', ' These stem from the possibility of renewed oil price increases and additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those announced and decided thus far. More fundamentally, stronger than currently expected wage developments would pose significant upward risks to price stability, particularly in view of the favourable momentum of real GDP growth. It is therefore crucial that the social partners continue to meet their responsibilities and that wage agreements take into account present relative price competitiveness positions, the still high level of unemployment in many countries as well as productivity developments. The Governing Council will monitor the upcoming wage negotiations in the euro area countries very carefully. Turning to the monetary analysis, this confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longer horizons. Annual M3 growth was unchanged at 9.8% in January, remaining at the highest rate observed since the introduction of the euro. At 10.6%, the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector also remained strong in January. This reflects the continuation of the upward trend in the growth of borrowing by non-financial corporations seen since mid-2004. Meanwhile, the growth of household borrowing has shown some further signs of moderation in recent months, albeit remaining at still high rates. Taking the appropriate medium to longer-term perspective, the latest developments confirm the continuation of a persistent upward trend in the underlying rate of monetary expansion. Furthermore, following several years of robust monetary growth, the liquidity situation in the euro area is ample by all plausible measures. The robust expansion of money and credit in an environment of ample liquidity points to upside risks to price stability over the medium to longer term. Monetary developments therefore continue to require very careful monitoring, particularly against the background of a solid expansion in economic activity and continued strong property market developments in many parts of the euro area. To sum up, in assessing price trends it is important to look through any', ' a result of unfavourable base effects. The medium to longer-term outlook for price stability remains subject to upside risks. They continue to include a stronger pass-through of past oil price rises into consumer prices than currently anticipated and additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those announced thus far. Furthermore, renewed increases in oil prices cannot be excluded. More fundamentally, stronger than currently expected wage developments pose substantial upward risks to price stability, given the favourable momentum of real GDP growth observed over the past few quarters, the fact that survey measures of capacity utilisation are approaching the peak levels reached in 2000, and the ongoing improvement in labour market performance. It is therefore crucial that the social partners continue to meet their responsibilities. In this context, wage agreements should take into account productivity developments while recognising the still high level of unemployment and price competitiveness positions. Indeed, the Governing Council will monitor the upcoming wage negotiations in the euro area countries very carefully. The monetary analysis confirms the prevailing upside risks to price stability at medium to longer horizons. Annual M3 growth rose further to 9.7% in December, marking the largest increase seen since the introduction of the euro. Of course, monthly figures can be volatile and we should not overemphasise short-term developments. However, continued strong money and credit growth confirm the view that the underlying rate of broad money expansion in the euro area remains vigorous, with no evidence as yet that the steady upward trend observed since mid-2004 has been halted or even reversed. The ongoing robust expansion of money and credit reflects the still accommodative monetary policy stance and the strengthening of economic activity in the euro area. At 10.7%, the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector remained strong in December, although showing a slight moderation with respect to the previous month. Strong growth in']"

The T2S project is the Eurosystem’s proposal for making cross-border securities settlement transactions in central bank money as secure, efficient and cheap as domestic settlement transactions are today. T2S will build on and benefit from the newly released TARGET2 system thereby combining cash and securities settlements– in real time - within a single European infrastructure. This will be Europe’s single “pipeline” settlement system, a system similar to those that have already been implemented by other economic areas. I firmly believe that T2S will contribute to speeding up market integration and fostering the necessary competition in Europe, to the benefit of financial participants and the citizens of Europe. The T2S project will act as a driver to remove even more barriers of the kind already identified by the Giovannini Group, as well as help users to identify the irreducible costs of unresolved barriers in the new efficient borderless settlement environment. This project will also advance the European harmonisation process, creating opportunities for further cost savings and allowing market participants to easily select and choose post-trade partners irrespective of their location within the single market. The impact of T2S on harmonisation is already being felt, building on the valuable work carried out by the CSDs. The harmonisation process goes far beyond pure settlement activities and will increase the pressure for swift action to harmonise practices, especially in relation to corporate activities, taxes, laws and regulations. The dynamic and second-round effects of T2S will pass through the market to increase trading activity, reduce trading spreads, increase competition and lower service prices, thus improving welfare in general.

In particular, T2S will be tightly integrated with the TARGET2 system, combining cash and securities settlements in a single shared platform in real time to provide the single European settlement platform for securities in central bank money, irrespective of the location of the issuer, the security or the settlement counterparty. This will create a single pool of securities available to market users and service providers through their chosen CSD, eliminating the costly process of cross-border security settlement in Europe. In this way, T2S will provide - just like an airport servicing various airlines - a basic infrastructure. In this basic infrastructure the CSDs can operate, offering - for example - a mix of products and services to their customers. In this regard, T2S will simply provide the basic platform that offers its services to all CDSs at the same unit costs. This will obviously contribute to more competition among the CSDs, leading to more transparent and efficient pricing, and facilitating competition to provide cross-border trading venues. This will create substantial gains for the European financial industry. Thanks to efforts made by hundreds of experts from over 80 European institutions and from the Eurosystem over the last year, the Governing Council of the ECB has been able in the last few weeks to invite the European CSDs to express their support for T2S. We have sent the European CSDs detailed user requirements, an economic impact analysis, a description of governance for the next project phase, and a presentation on harmonisation efforts in the context of T2S. These are the outcome of a transparent and constructive consultation process, cooperating with CSDs and market users.', ' T2S joins other European initiatives, such as the Code of Conduct and the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), in helping to fulfil the objectives set out by the Lisbon agenda for the provision of better services to issuers and investors. We firmly believe that T2S will speed up market integration and foster competition. The T2S settlement system will act as a driver to promote harmonisation within the European securities industry, creating opportunities for cost savings and allowing market participants to select and choose post-trade partners irrespective of their location within the single market. The impact of T2S on harmonisation is already being felt, building on valuable work by the CSDs. The ICSDs’ experience in bringing together several national CSDs has created valuable impetus in this respect. The next speaker will also contribute to this debate by highlighting the advantages of such harmonisation. The Eurosystem, inter alia through the T2S project, will play a leading role in working with market participants to harmonise market practices at the European level for the benefit of those participants. This work is likely to remove even more barriers of the kind already identified by the Giovannini Group, as well as helping users to identify the irreducible costs of unresolved barriers in the new efficient borderless settlement environment. This work will also increase the pressure for swift action to harmonise practices that do not constitute pure settlement activities, especially in relation to corporate activities, taxes, laws and regulations. T2S will harmonise the real-time life cycle management functionality for settlement instructions. T2S will also harmonise the settlement model and will offer daily real-time and night-time cycle modules. Market participants will therefore follow one common set of harmonised settlement procedures irrespective of whether they are settling securities domestically or cross-border.']"

We will now report on the outcome of today’s meeting of the Governing Council, which was also attended by Commissioner Almunia. Based on its regular economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The current rates remain appropriate. Taking into account all the information and analyses that have become available since our meeting on 5 November 2009, price developments are expected to remain subdued over the policy-relevant horizon. The latest information also confirms the expected improvement in economic activity in the second half of this year, with euro area real GDP growth returning to positive territory in the third quarter of 2009. However, some of the factors supporting the recovery at present are of a temporary nature. The Governing Council expects the euro area economy to grow at a moderate pace in 2010, recognising that the recovery process is likely to be uneven and that the outlook remains subject to high uncertainty. The outcome of the monetary analysis confirms the assessment of low inflationary pressure over the medium term, as money and credit growth continues to slow down. All in all, we expect price stability to be maintained over the medium term, thereby supporting the purchasing power of euro area households. Medium to longer-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. At today’s meeting we also decided to continue conducting our main refinancing operations (MROs) as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment for as long as is needed – and at least until the third maintenance period of 2010 ends on 13 April.

On the basis of our regular economic and monetary analyses, we decided at today’s meeting to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged. The information that has become available since our last meeting has further underpinned the reasoning behind our decision to increase interest rates in March. It has also confirmed that the medium-term outlook for price stability remains subject to upside risks, so that very close monitoring of all developments is warranted. Indeed, it is essential to ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise. This will contribute to ensuring that medium to longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area remain solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability. Such anchoring is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting sustainable economic growth and job creation in the euro area. Given the favourable economic environment, our monetary policy continues to be on the accommodative side, with the key ECB interest rates moderate, money and credit growth vigorous, and liquidity in the euro area ample by all plausible measures. Therefore, looking ahead, acting in a firm and timely manner to ensure price stability in the medium term is warranted. Turning first to the economic analysis , recent information has underpinned our assessment of ongoing robust economic growth dynamics in the euro area.

The information that has become available since our last meeting has further underpinned the reasoning behind our decision to increase interest rates in March.

While a re-anchoring of longer-term inflation expectations around the two per cent target rate acts as a stabilising force and reinforces the credibility of the inflation target, complacency should be avoided. In particular, the current prolonged phase of spot inflation rates far above the target might lead some types of economic actors to make further upward revisions to their near-term and medium-term inflation expectations. Accordingly, it is essential for the ECB to monitor closely a wide array of indicators of inflation expectations and to ensure that its commitment to delivering two per cent inflation over the medium term is understood by the full spectrum of economic actors.

It suggests that the net wealth of homeowners declined by 6 percentage points more than the wealth of renters. The decline was especially marked for homeowners with mortgages, for whom it amounted to as much as around 20 percent. Growth of median net wealth by housing status, 2011-14 (HICP-adjusted; percentages) Source: Household Finance and Consumption Survey, waves 1 and 2. Note: The chart shows the growth rates of the median net wealth in the euro area for outright owners, owners with a mortgage and renters from 2011 to 2014, deflated by the HICP. Assessing the overall implications of these many dimensions of heterogeneity is challenging. Recent ECB research suggests that the most important dimension of heterogeneity is related to employment status. [ 12 ] Following an easing of monetary policy conditions, there are disproportionate increases in income in the lower part of the income distribution, which results in a decline in measured income inequality. By contrast, since a majority of households are homeowners, an increase in house prices due to a looser monetary policy has a relatively even impact of house prices across the wealth distribution. [ 13 ] At the same time, it is worth keeping in mind that the degree of home ownership can vary considerably across countries. The more concentrated ownership of equities and bonds among households means that this component of the wealth distribution varies with the monetary stance, even while recalling that many households have indirect financial holdings through pension funds and other types of investment vehicles. From a broader perspective, we should also bear in mind that the contribution of monetary policy to changes in inequality is small, compared with the role of fiscal policy (especially the degree of redistribution in the design of the tax and transfer systems)', ' in the lowest income quintile. [ 24 ] The effect is economically important as in that quintile unemployment rates drop by more than 2 percentage points. For the remaining income quintiles the drop in the unemployment rates does not exceed 0.5 percentage points. These changes in the employment status affect the distribution of income and, overall, tend to compress income inequality. [ 25 ] This result confirms that, from the distributional perspective, the main impact of expansionary monetary policies is on the reduction of unemployment with positive effects on the reduction of inequality. The positive overall effect of unemployment reductions and wage increases on the income distribution is shown on Chart 9. The mean income in the lowest quintile increases by almost 3.5%, which is substantially higher than the impact in the rest of the distribution. These changes have effects on the income distribution with the Gini coefficient on income declining from 43.1 to 42.8. Chart 9: Effects of Asset Purchase Programs on the income distribution Source: ECB calculations, Eurosystem Household Finance and Consumption Survey. Note: The numbers in brackets show initial household income levels. Euro area aggregates are calculated as the total for the four large countries: Germany, Spain, France and Italy. In conclusion, let me summarise these findings in two main points. First, the effects of monetary policy on aggregate measures of inequality, such as the Gini coefficient are rather modest, compared to the low-frequency dynamics of these indicators over the past several decades. This is more the case for household wealth than for income. In particular, non-standard monetary policy measures can have substantial income (and employment) effects for subgroups of households such as the unemployed. Those measures can improve their welfare and contribute toward reducing income disparities, at least in the short-term. Second, the low-frequency dynamics in', ') and disposable (net) income is almost 20 percentage points, more than twice the difference in other countries. Chart 2: Fiscal redistribution of income in the EU and other countries Source: Caminada and Wang (2014). Note: The chart shows the extent of the fiscal redistribution as given by the difference between the Gini coefficients on market (gross) income and disposable (net) income. The slow-moving nature of inequality is also confirmed with the more recent survey data from the Eurosystem Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS). Chart 3 summarises the euro area distributions of household income and net wealth [ 10 ] since 2010. Chart 3: Income and net wealth inequality in the euro area Source: Eurosystem Household Finance and Consumption Survey, waves 1 and 2. Note: The chart shows gross household income and net wealth per household, defined as the sum of total assets net of total liabilities Both the distribution of income and the distribution of household net wealth remained stable. For example, the Gini coefficient on net wealth increased only modestly, from 68.0% in 2010 to 68.5% in 2013. Similarly, the share of the top 5% of households on total net wealth remained between 37% and 38%. Based on the evidence mentioned above, one could already draw some tentative implications for monetary policy. First, given the slow-moving nature of inequality, one could argue that the prevailing monetary policy regime, defining long term goals, is likely to be the most important factor through which central banks may influence the distribution of income and wealth. For example, the conquest of inflation in countries going through prolonged experiences of high inflation is arguably an important factor contributing to the reduction in inequality. The second tentative implication is that, for a given monetary policy framework committed to a low inflation regime, the specific measures adopted']"

[ 3 ] To judge whether the financial sector has grown “too large”, it is crucial to answer the question of whether or not the expansion of finance before the crisis was driven by fundamentals. On the one hand, it is clear that this process was fuelled by fast economic growth and a rapid accumulation of savings in emerging markets. On the other hand, developed countries engaged in rapid innovation in the field of financial products, which allowed the more efficient channelling of domestic and global savings towards productive investments. The most striking developments in this respect occurred with credit default swaps (CDSs) and securitised products. This increase in financial innovation may, in turn, have led to an inefficient allocation of resources, excessive risk-taking and over-leveraging of the system. Examples of such resource misallocation include the expansion of the US subprime mortgage market and of the shadow banking system. Similarly, while we have always known that financial innovation can contribute to enhancing risk diversification, it is clear that innovative financial instruments also have the potential to undermine financial stability. For example, the complexity of new instruments might lead to a misallocation of capital and risk among market participants. In this respect, the crisis has exposed the fragilities of the securitisation process, including the misalignment of incentives among agents participating in the origination and in the distribution, lack of transparency with regard to the risks underlying securitised products and the inadequate management of the risks associated with the securitisation business.

Third , distorted incentives that, inter alia , adversely affected the implementation of the “originate and distribute” model by banks and other market participants in the chain of origination, distribution and acquisition of credit risks; Fourth , the emergence of new financial entities – the off-balance sheet conduits and structured investment vehicles – which were sponsored by banks and which were characterised by excessive leverage and maturity mismatches on their balance sheets, because they held illiquid structured finance products and financed them by issuing short-term asset-backed commercial paper; Fifth , and last on my list, imperfect information about the quality and performance of underlying assets, inadequate transparency about the characteristics and risks of structured finance products and insufficient disclosure about the risk exposures of financial institutions as a result of their on- and off-balance sheet holdings. This list of other contributing factors and system weaknesses – and it is not an exhaustive list – shows that it was not the processes of financial integration and innovation per se that were responsible for the market turmoil. Other specific factors such as inadequate risk management, valuation problems and uncertainties, distorted incentives, imperfect information, insufficient transparency and disclosure played a crucial role in the propagation and amplification of shocks. Put differently, the rapid advances in financial innovation and integration had not been accompanied by adequate appreciation of risk, effective risk management and sufficient market discipline. The turmoil partly reflects this divergence between financial innovation and integration, on the one hand, and effective risk management and sufficient market discipline, on the other.

[ 3 ] Public pension reforms are on the agenda of most governments in the euro area, some of which have already introduced extensive changes to their public pension systems. Given the objectives of maintaining public pension systems on a financially sustainable path and public debt sustainability, pension reforms have generally moved in three directions: i) an increase in contribution rates, ii) a reduction in replacement rates and iii) a higher retirement age (although in some countries the effective retirement age remains well below the statutory retirement age). This implies that benefits have generally been reduced and that retirement income relative to wage has declined. Projected changes in life expectancy are surrounded by considerable uncertainty, longevity risk . Governments, through their public social security systems, bear a collective longevity risk, due to unexpected changes in mortality trends. By definition, this risk cannot be diversified within the members of the same cohort, as it affects all individuals in the same way. Public pension reforms are, at least partially, transferring this risk to the individuals, promoting a move towards systems where benefits depend on the accumulated value of contributions (both public and private). Individual longevity risk can be diversified to some extent, insofar as financial markets can provide us with instruments that can help to manage longevity risk, as well as other kinds of risks. [Slide 3: Outline of my presentation] In the rest of my intervention today, I will talk about the relationship between demographic changes and financial markets. I will start with the consequences we may observe in the future – when the current baby boom generation retires – and will continue with the changes in financial structures that we are already witnessing today. I will describe how population ageing can', '. Moreover, this impact might be augmented by the additional and more general downward pressure on the long end of the yield curve stem\\xadming from the possible general decline in interest rates owing to population aging. 4.2 Aging and the financial intermediation process Let me now turn to some of the consequences of population aging for the financial intermediation process and the structure of financial systems more generally. We are already observing important changes in the role and functioning of the retirement savings industry. Confronted with population aging, governments are finding it increasingly difficult to maintain the entitlements of the existing public pension schemes. Many governments are moving in the direction of reducing benefits relative to contributions to public pension schemes, reducing the ratio of the post-retirement income to the net pre-retirement income. Faced with these changes or prospects, individuals will be increasingly supporting their old-age consumption via alternative pension plans. Thus it can be expected that a larger proportion of household savings will be placed in privately funded pension schemes and life insurance policies. [ 14 ] Accordingly, over the coming decades, a significant increase can be expected in the value of assets managed by the retirement savings industry, particularly in countries where this industry is less developed and there are underfunded public pension systems with defined benefits. The Netherlands is an exceptional case among the euro area countries in this respect, since in this country the pension fund indus\\xadtry is of a significant size. As key financial intermediaries, banks will, of course, also be very much affected by population aging. What are the likely effects? Given the long-term nature of the effects of population aging and the wide range of possible counterbalancing forces, the answer to this question is highly tentative and should not be interpreted as a prediction. Demographic changes – through their impact on GDP and population growth rates', ' economies. In my speech today, I will touch on three issues. First, I would like to emphasise the role of private pension funds in an ageing society. Second, I will briefly describe the role of private pension funds in financial markets in general and look more specifically at their role as long-term oriented investors in the current environment. Thirdly, I will reflect on the impact of institutional investors on the transmission of monetary policy and the ensuing consequences for the conduct of monetary policy. The role of private pension funds in an ageing society Let me start with a piece of good news: between now and 2040, we are all expected to live longer as life expectancy increases. For this we all wish to have a financially secure retirement. This, however, requires that we will all have to save more or work longer. Confronted with population aging, governments are finding it increasingly challenging to maintain the entitlements of the existing public pension schemes. Many governments are moving in the direction of reducing benefits relative to contributions to public pension schemes, reducing the ratio of the post-retirement income to the net pre-retirement income. Mandatory private pensions also operate as substitutes for part of the public pension provision, but in some countries, mandatory private pension saving has been added on top of existing public plans. Thus it is clear that, individuals will be increasingly supporting their old-age consumption via alternative, private pension plans and life insurance policies. In this context, I see a need for public authorities to foster conditions that encourage and are conducive to saving, particularly in countries with a strong ageing of the population. Over the coming decades, as the “first pillar” of old-age provision will increasingly need to be complemented by a strong “second pillar” of occupational pension funds, a significant increase in the value']"

However, this reasoning may be incomplete. One example is the case of negative deposit certificate rates at the Danish central bank that I already mentioned. So obviously, under certain circumstances, some assets provide particular services that make market participants willing to hold these assets although they display negative interest rates. To understand the nature of the question on possible negative deposit rates in the euro area, let me quickly recall that the ECB operates a corridor system consisting of three rates. First, the main refinancing rate is the interest the ECB charges in the main refinancing operations with its counterparties. It usually provides the mid-point of the corridor system. Second, the marginal lending rate is the interest charged on overnight lending from the Eurosystem to banks. It constitutes the ceiling of the corridor system. Third, the deposit facility rate governs the remuneration for excess reserves that our counterparties hold with the Eurosystem as overnight deposits. It constitutes the floor to the corridor system. Moreover, it also provides the floor on interbank market rates as banks have no incentive to lend funds below this rate in the market. Setting the deposit rate to a value below zero would imply that the remuneration for excess reserves in the euro area is negative. In other words, banks are charged for making overnight deposits with the ECB. From a technical point of view, we are ready to implement a negative deposit facility rate. And, in general, there are constellations conceivable where the Eurosystem could deploy such a negative rate, if it is deemed required by our mandate to safeguard price stability. So what are the pros and cons? Theoretically, a negative deposit rate may', ' 2 ). In other words, the ECB had succeeded in shifting the perceived lower bound on interest rates firmly into negative territory, supported by forward guidance that left the door open for the possibility of further rate cuts. This restored a fundamentally important element of monetary policy: the possibility for the market to anticipate further policy cuts and to thereby frontload policy accommodation. The zero lower bound was no longer constraining market expectations. As the market started repricing the full expected future interest rate path, the effects of the cut in the DFR extended well beyond short-term rates. A decomposition analysis by ECB staff shows that the NIRP contributed to shifting euro area sovereign yields downwards across the full maturity spectrum, with a peak around the five-year segment ( Chart 3 ). [ 4 ] These effects were reinforced by a compression of the term premium: negative rates strengthen the incentives of investors to rebalance their portfolios towards longer-dated securities. The propagation of a rate cut in negative territory was therefore materially stronger along the yield curve than for a conventional rate cut, which typically has very little impact on longer maturities. Negative interest rates reinforced the effects of our asset purchases for the same reasons: when banks’ excess reserves are remunerated at negative rates, there is a strong incentive to reduce them by shifting into riskier assets, such as longer-dated government bonds. [ 5 ] This strengthens the portfolio rebalancing channel of asset purchases. This “hot potato effect” also extends to bank loans, which was the second objective of lowering rates into negative territory. With the start of negative rates, we have observed a steady increase in the growth rate of loans extended by euro area monetary financial institutions ( Chart 4 ). An ECB meta-analysis of various studies corroborates the view that the use of the NIRP', ', including those of Denmark, Switzerland, Sweden and Japan, have also experimented with negative policy rates in recent years. A negative nominal interest rate on the deposit facility means that commercial banks must pay for parking their deposits with the ECB. It incentivises credit creation and a greater velocity of circulation of excess reserves held at the central bank. Negative rates stimulate the economy via the usual channels: lowering real yields and bank lending rates at various maturities, encouraging borrowing and real activity. In this context, negative policy rates have been an effective tool in the euro area, lowering not only short-term rates but also rates at longer maturities via expectations. The successful use of negative policy rates in the euro area and in other countries suggests that this instrument may become part of the conventional toolkit of central banks for fighting recessions. However, one needs to take into account that there is still an effective lower bound on nominal interest rates as discussed earlier: the presence of non-trivial costs of storing and handling currency means that the effective lower bound is somewhere below zero. From an economic perspective, what may be even more important is the possibility that below a certain threshold, called by some economists the “reversal rate”, policy rates going further into negative territory may become counterproductive. This would happen because of the detrimental effect of negative interest rates on bank profitability and lending, especially in an environment in which banks are largely financed with retail deposits at non-negative nominal interest rates. [ 45 ] All in all, under current monetary arrangements, negative rates can only be seen as a special tool with limited room for manoeuvre, to be used only in extreme circumstances. This has always been the actual intention underlying the ECB negative rate policy – to boost aggregate demand, closing the output gap more quickly, helping to normalise']"

         "[' length of these proceedings would increase the average firm size by 8-12%. [ 6 ] Above all, it is crucial to improve the environment for firms in Italy. It’s necessary to ensure clear and predictable rules, effective judicial protection, respect for contracts. The efficiency of public administration, a well-functioning labour market and the promotion of competition are essential. In recent years various initiatives in these areas have been taken. It’s good to continue along this path. Ensuring that capital can flow to the most productive firms also requires a healthy banking sector that can expand credit. This in turn means that any bad loans that have been made in the past need to appear without delay on the balance sheets of the intermediaries and that steps need to be taken quickly to resolve the problem. That process has already begun with the ECB’s comprehensive assessment. The ECB looks favourably on new initiatives to help Italian banks reduce the weight of impaired items on their balance sheets; they will free up resources and above all be of benefit to firms. Finally, perhaps the most important thing is to equip people with the right skills to be able to find jobs in the firms of the future. [ 7 ] Italy, like the rest of the Europe, is engaged in a global economy in which technological progress tends to favour skilled over unskilled labour, raising its relative productivity and demand. So skills have to evolve everywhere. In the euro area today skills and employment are already strongly linked. In 2013 more than 19% of workers [ 8 ] with low education levels were unemployed, compared with only 7% of highly educated workers. This is why education and training need to be as much a part of the reform agenda as cleaning up banks and reducing red tape. Improving skills also has another dimension. Reallocating resources creates both', ' services. Improve the flexibility of the labour market, in order to raise participation, address the duality of the labour market and further strengthen the link between wages and productivity. All these actions would raise the growth potential of the economy. L’Espresso: And Italy, in particular, where the debt ratio is close to 120%? Trichet: It is vital to continue to pursue a very prudent fiscal policy. Major efforts should be made to fully achieve public sector spending cuts and to increase efficiency in tax collection in order to implement a credible and ambitious consolidation strategy. The multi-annual package approved in 2010 and the recently approved 2011 budget go in the right direction, and Italy should seize any opportunity presented by better budgetary and economic conditions to accelerate deficit and debt reduction. L’Espresso: What causes more concern: Italy’s debt, its low productivity or its political instability? Trichet: To all countries our message is the same: sound fiscal policies and structural reforms are of the essence. Particularly important, for all, is continuity in the adjustment policies so that the credibility of the economy is progressively reinforced. I will add that, in a country like Italy, which possesses remarkable human resources and an equally exceptional entrepreneurial spirit, the very low level of productivity growth is to be corrected without delay. Improving flexibility in markets, improving education and training, fostering universities of excellence and enhancing research and development are among the necessary measures. L’Espresso: Merkel has suggested raising the retirement age to 67 across the whole of Europe. Is this a useful suggestion? Trichet: Taking into account the progress of medicine and the permanent lengthening of life expectancy in all advanced economies, there is a need to extend the retirement age itself, as is being done in practically all countries.', ' us to do, and because it is a major contribution to sustainable growth and job creation in Europe. Where do you see risks of price increases? Further increases in oil and commodity prices and in goods and services prices due to past oil price increases. Also additional unexpected increases in administrative prices and indirect taxes. Then, more fundamentally, there are the so-called second-round effects, that is the risk of increases in wages and salaries that would derive from a loss of credibility regarding our capability in countering price increases. It is essential to intervene before these effects materialise. Do your concerns include the increase in VAT to be implemented in Germany in January? The increase in VAT in Germany, which was decided upon some time ago by the government, had already been incorporated in our analysis. You were in Cernobbio, Italy, in early September. What was the mood among Italian entrepreneurs, politicians and economists? I saw further confirmation of the great potential of Italy and of the Italian corporate sector, but I also found unanimous agreement that one of the most important problems facing Italy is the insufficient labour productivity and consequently the rise of unit labour costs. It is a European problem, and not only an Italian problem, but in Italy it is particularly visible: we have to do all that we can to implement the Lisbon agenda aiming at accelerating productivity growth. But the Italian industrial structure is weak nowadays. What should be done? Research carried out in Italy and in Europe, more generally, has concluded that we are not benefiting sufficiently from productivity gains in sectors that use new technology (and not only in the sectors that produce the technology themselves) and this seems to be due to overly rigid labour, goods and services and financial markets. Structural reforms that would allow the economy to be made more flexible are the primary tools for achieving a leap in productivity.']"

         "[', Europe’s underdeveloped venture capital environment, fragmented equity markets and heterogenous national markets are leading to higher financing costs and inefficiencies in the allocation of capital when compared with the United States. To overcome Europe’s private investment gap and give European firms access to the financing they need, especially in terms of equity, we need a more ambitious agenda for both developing and integrating EU capital markets. First, household savings should be directed towards capital markets. A retail savings product that offers tax incentives and could be sold across the EU would be a step forward. The same goes for lowering the entry barriers for retail investors to participate in equity and bond markets. Increasing the share of equity investments in funded pension systems would also have mutually reinforcing benefits. It would give institutional investors, such as pension funds, a greater role in providing a large investor base for equity markets, similar to the role they now play in the United States. [ 13 ] Ensuring the portability of pensions across borders, as envisaged when launching the Pan-European Personal Pension Product, will also be fundamental in supporting the single labour market by enhancing mobility for workers in Europe. Second, regulatory action can encourage investment in equity by addressing the debt-equity bias in taxation. Simplifying regulation can attract investors, promote risk-taking by Europe’s companies and boost cross-border market developments. For instance, streamlining eligibility requirements in the UCITS [ 14 ] and European Venture Capital Fund [ 15 ] directives could incentivise investment in venture capital funds and make the most of the “passport” system that facilitates the distribution of funds throughout the EU. Third, to develop the equity market, we need to make listings in Europe more attractive and efficient. To this end, we should aim to create a single pool of liquidity for public', ' supply of equity finance. Policies which stimulate individual ownership of traded shares, such as reducing the tax advantage of debt over equity or enhancing financial literacy, can have a material effect on public equity markets in Europe. At the same time, because stock markets often penalise companies which undertake radical, but uncertain, innovative activities, the contribution of private equity – particularly in the form of early-stage venture capital finance – is indispensable, as a critical mass of angel investors who can provide financing for medium-size projects is also needed. Only with a deep, liquid market is it possible to launch IPOs of successful projects that can offset the losses with projects that fail. Harmonising insolvency rules across jurisdictions would be a major step towards supporting capital markets. This is critical for mobilising finance through capital markets, as it would create incentives and favourable conditions for institutional investors to overcome the home bias in their investment strategies. This is especially true for pension investment, as large private pension funds tend to be a complement to deep capital markets. We need to establish a harmonised regulatory environment for new types of finance, such as crowd funding. The emergence of increasingly complex financial products needs to be accompanied by adequate consumer protection of financial investment, in order to safeguard financial stability and ensure the protection of individual investors. The second component of a comprehensive approach entails policies that will stimulate entrepreneurship. High-tech entrepreneurial firms that aspire to go public should be supported and facilitated by stock exchanges specialising in IPOs for young innovative companies. A reduction in the wedge between corporate income taxes and personal income taxes has already been shown to have a strong positive effect on high-tech investment in a European context. [ 21 ] Last but not least, the efficient application of R&D tax incentives and increased public funding of private research universities, whose labs often make key scientific and', ' a material effect on public equity markets in Europe. At the same time, because stock markets often penalise companies which undertake radical, but uncertain, innovative activities, the contribution of private equity – particularly in the form of early-stage venture capital finance – is indispensable, as a critical mass of angel investors who can provide financing for medium-size projects is also needed. Only with a deep, liquid market is it possible to launch IPOs of successful projects that can offset the losses with projects that fail. I recently underlined [ 45 ] the importance of building a genuine CMU by saying: “With CMU, we should aim to reach a situation where both issuers and investors enjoy the same basic legal rights concerning capital markets activity regardless of the EU country where they are located. The CMU project involves all EU member states but it is particularly important for the euro area member countries. It is a big waste to have taken the huge step to adopt a single currency and continue to forgo the benefits that could be reaped by creating a true banking and capital markets union. I believe that euro area countries should forge ahead in enhanced co-operation in order to achieve CMU more rapidly. We should however, be well aware that CMU requires a European safe asset, the harmonisation of taxes on financial products, a convergence of company law, including on bankruptcy, the creation of a single rule book of regulation for markets activity and ultimately a European Single Securities Market Supervisor. The other big condition is a rock solid monetary union so that assets’ risks and returns are not significantly influenced by redenomination risk but exclusively by their idiosyncratic features. A heavy toll, I know, but I will believe that the CMU project is possible when I see authorities start making inroads in some of those difficult issues.”']"

         "[' and the result is grotesque. The central bank fights for more inflation. That’s strange for Germans, whose country has suffered two periods of hyperinflation and fears a new currency reform. Do you understand the unease of the people of this country? Draghi: History shows that falling prices can be as damaging to the prosperity and stability of our countries as high inflation. That is why our mandate is symmetric. And that is why we are now ensuring that the risk of deflation you just asked me about does not materialise. You, as a journalist, also have a duty to explain. Public opinion in Germany is very important for us. Your intentions are good, the effects of your policies are simply not acceptable for many citizens. People are worried about their savings and pensions. They did not invest money, like Goldman Sachs, in shares, options and highly controversial bonds, but focused with your majority – rather conservatively – on savings books, German government bonds and life insurance policies. Because of the ECB’s low interest rate policy, they are currently experiencing a clear drop in wealth. Savings accounts and insurance policy pay-outs are melting. Draghi: Interest rates have been very, very low for a long time – and they will presumably stay like that for a while longer. People see that the returns on their savings and the profits from their life insurance policies are shrinking. We understand the concerns of savers. But now let me ask a question: is that the only factor? My answer is no. After the crisis, Germany became a safe haven. A lot of money therefore flowed into the country, with the result of falling interest rates on medium and long term bonds – the interest rates of which are not set by the ECB. This has hurt some savers but also benefitted borrowers, for', '12 December 2013 Interview with Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, and Zeit, conducted by Mark Schieritz on 9 December 2013. Mr Cœuré, do you know what the interest rate on savings accounts in Germany is? Very low, probably close to 0%. That’s correct. Some banks pay 0.25% or even less. Can you relate to savers in Germany being annoyed that the European Central Bank (ECB) is making them foot the bill for the crisis? Rates are very low because the euro area economy is weak. Take the example of low long-term interest rates on German government bonds, which are important for life insurance contracts and pensions. Why exactly is the weak economy responsible for low rates? If growth is weak, there are few profitable investment opportunities. As savings need to be invested in order to achieve returns, this means that returns are low. Low market rates also, however, create the conditions for new growth and this will also boost future returns on savings. So you are saying that German savers benefit from the ECB’s low rates? My message is: it is important to differentiate between long-term rates for savers and the policy rate of the ECB. Long-term rates are low because the economy is weak. In such circumstances, the ECB has to set its policy rate in such a way as to ensure price stability. Thereby we support the economy and create the conditions for profitable investment opportunities – and this is also of benefit to German savers. So what would you say to Germans who are worried about their retirement provision? I would tell them that the best way to improve the return on their savings is for the crisis to be solved as quickly as possible. This means that the economic', ' while gross domestic product would have been between 2.5% and 3.0% lower. In your speech in Karlsruhe you also pointed out that the narrative of the expropriation of German savers was faulty alone on the grounds that there is no entitlement to high interest rates on savings and because it is not part of the ECB’s mandate to ensure returns for savers. Yes, and, first and foremost, some people tend to take an overly negative view of the effect of low interest rates and to overestimate it. The average real interest rate that has been earned on savings and demand deposits in Germany since the introduction of the euro is approximately the same as the equivalent average rate over the preceding 24 years. Moreover, Germany consists not only of savers, but also of borrowers, taxpayers, home owners and workers. Looking purely at the interest account for a representative German household over the period from 2007 to 2017, there is even a small plus on the bottom line. Precisely the middle income group, which is the group with the most borrowers, has benefited from the low interest rate policy. And you don’t share the concern that low interest rates keep firms in operation that would have had to fold under normal circumstances? This concern is not supported by empirical research. The data simply show no trace of a systematic increase in the number of unprofitable firms during the years of expansionary monetary policy. On the contrary, that number has actually declined. More favourable financing conditions benefit all firms, but most of all profitable, healthy firms, to whom banks are more willing to provide favourable loans than they are to unprofitable and highly indebted ones. So this narrative does not hold up either to a closer scrutiny of the economic interconnections and empirical research. But, at the end of']"
